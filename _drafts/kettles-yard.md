Little bit on the gormley exhibit. Interesting, but not his best stuff imo (except the infinite cube owns)

“The Louvre of the pebbles”
Gosh it’s fantastic, it’s exactly my taste, especially in the sunshine. Salt bleached and perfect. If grand designs were performed by not utter cretins.

I’ve been reading Possession, which also conforms very strongly to an aesthetic. I worry that i can never 
be one thing, I can never choose to live one way, conflicting tastes and opinions (my own and others) pull me this way and that. 

To do one thing entails going slowly I think. But I can never go slow, my attention can’t rest. That’s a common trope that I think is a little misinformed: that the pace of life was slower in the past. For most people there was even less time than there is now; the people we hear most from from the past we’re the rich who didn’t need to work. But there’s still some truth in there being so much media, so many entertaining options that I do everything badly rather than one thing we’ll.

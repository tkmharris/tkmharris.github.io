## Maths
Between 2011 and 2015 I did a PhD with [Dr. Bernhard K&ouml;ck](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/bk2.page) at the University of Southampton. My research was in algebraic K-theory. My [thesis](/assets/files/thesis.pdf) was about Grayson's algebraic presentation of the higher algebraic K-groups.

#### Publications

in *Homology, Homotopy and Applications **17** (2015), no. 1, 267-280.*

2. [Exterior power operations on higher K-groups via binary complexes](/assets/files/ExteriorPowersBinaryComplexes.pdf)

The series of [seminars for undergraduates](http://ugseminars.co.nf/) I started while I was a graduate student is still going strong.

## 2 ingredient banana oat biscuits

This is a good way to use up old bananas that have gone a bit soft.
(Another good thing to do with those is to chop them up, freeze them, and use them in smoothies later.)

#### Ingredients

* 2 soft bananas
* 2 cups porridge oats
* Optional add-ins, e.g.:
  * chopped walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts
  * dried cranberries, or raisins
  * (dark) chocolate chips
  * mixed seeds


#### Method

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.

Mash the bananas until smooth and blend together with the oats
(for a smoother biscuit, blend the oats into a flour first). Sprinkle
the optional add-ins throughout the mixture.

Grease a baking tray. Make small balls out of the mixture and press
them into biscuit shapes about ~1.5cm thick on the tray. Bake for ~10
minutes or until the biscuits are set. Cool on a wire rack.

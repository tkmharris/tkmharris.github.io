I'm back in Southampton after a great week in Strasbourg, where I learned a lot
and also met some
<a href="/assets/img/2015-02-28/Strasbourg_pals.jpg" data-lightbox="strasbourg">
nice people</a> who I hope I'll stay in touch with.

As one would expect from a masterclass on topological K-theory, a recurring
theme was the following 8-periodic sequence of groups:<br>
<span>
\\(  \mathbb{Z} / 2 \ \ \mathbb{Z} / 2 \ \ 0 \ \ \mathbb{Z} \ \ 0 \ \ 0 \ \ 0 \ \ \mathbb{Z}. \\)
</span>
</br>
I remember somewhere seeing this sequence referred to as 'Bott's song'.
It doesn't seem to be in common usage, but I think it's a charming name and I
hope it catches on. And if the *KO\** tune proves too hard to follow,
there's always *KU\**, Bott's song for beginners: <br>
\\( \mathbb{Z} \ \ 0 \\)
*(repeat)*.

**EDIT** I've since been informed by
[Carl McTague](http://www.mctague.org/carl/) that Bott's song goes to the
tune of *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star*:

> *zee-two, zee-two, zero, zee, zero, zero, zero, zee*

(It sounds better sang in American.)

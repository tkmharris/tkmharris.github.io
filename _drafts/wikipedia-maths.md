you can't actually learn anything, it should be more like the princeton companion (but not written by experts), or the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.
Note: I'm very conscious of the long history of debate over what wikipedia is and what it is not.
Suffice to say there are inclusionists and exclusionists.
I think my problem is not contained in that line, but nor is it orthogonal.

Blake Stacey already did a good post about this:

Not a lot more that I can say, except that editorialising is even more important for maths because maths is about picking out which truths are important from a sea of tautologues; other sciences pick out what is important by what describes the real world.

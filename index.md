I am a person who tries to be interested in things. This is where I keep stuff on the web.

Details of my mathematical work can be found under the [maths](./maths/) tab.
Sometimes I [blog](./blog/) about the things I do,
or the things that interest me.

Outside of maths, I like running, hiking, swimming outdoors, and
[reading books](/booklist/). My favourite number is 26.

Hello, welcome to my home page. I'm Tom, I live in Cambridge, UK, and I commission and edit maths books for CUP.  
I'm a person who tries to be interested in things. The things I like to think about most are:  

  * pure mathematics (PhD)
  * logic and formal systems in general
  * fiction
  * cultural studies (total amatuer)

For recreation, I like running, hiking, swimming outdoors, and
[reading books](/books/).

I post infrequently on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Eschatom) and much more frequently on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/users/tomharris). I put pictures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tkmharris/) and collect interesting links on [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:tkmharris).

### Maths
Between 2011 and 2015 I did my PhD in algebraic K-theory with [Dr. Bernhard K&ouml;ck](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/bk2.page) at the University of Southampton.  
My [thesis](/assets/files/thesis.pdf) was about Grayson's algebraic presentation of the higher algebraic K-groups.


#### Publications
1. [Algebraic proofs of some fundamental theorems in algebraic K-theory](/assets/files/FundamentalTheoremsAlgebraicKtheory.pdf)  
in *Homology, Homotopy and Applications **17** (2015), no. 1, 267-280.*

2. [Exterior power operations on higher K-groups via binary complexes](/assets/files/ExteriorPowersBinaryComplexes.pdf)  
(with Bernhard K&ouml;ck and Lenny Taelman)  
in *Annals of K-Theory 2-3 (2017), 409--450.*

#### Other
Here are some notes on the [Pisano semiperiod](/assets/files/pisano_semiperiod.pdf).

A series of [seminars for undergraduates](http://ugseminars.co.nf/) I started while I was a graduate student.

### Blog
I've been keeping a [blog](http://www.tkmharris.net/blog/) for the last couple of years. There's no particular topic: sometimes it's reflections on things I've been reading or thinking about, but other times it's more like a diary (especially if I've been somewhere interesting recently). I suppose the topic is "things I'd like to share with my friends". That's good enough, I think.

### Misc
Some of my favourite [recipes](/recipes/).

[Wishlist](/wishlist/), if you need to get me a gift.

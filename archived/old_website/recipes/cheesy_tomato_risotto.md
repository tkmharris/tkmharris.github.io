## Cheesy tomato risotto

Makes 2 dinner portions

#### Ingredients

* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped and crushed
* ~150g mushrooms, chopped
* 1 pepper, chopped (I usually use half a red one and half a yellow one)
* 200g risotto rice
* 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* ~100g grated cheese (more if desired)
* butter/oil
* 500ml veg stock
* salt/pepper/basil to season

#### Method

Melt the butter/ heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the chopped onion and garlic until soft. Add the mushrooms and continue to fry until they are browned. Add the peppers when the mushrooms are close to being done.

When all the veg is reasonably fried, add the dry risotto rice to the and stir it around to mix the veg through. Then add the veg stock and chopped tomatoes. Add salt/pepper/basil to season.

Bring to a low simmer and cook until almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Now stir in the grated cheese until it melts. Take off the heat and serve in bowls with crusty bread.

#### Variations

The Mushrooms and pepper can be changed or added to with any other veg you want really. Thinly sliced butternut squash or courgette is nice.

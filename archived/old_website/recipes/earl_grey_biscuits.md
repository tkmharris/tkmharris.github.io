## Earl Grey biscuits

#### Ingredients

* 2 cups plain flour
* 2 tbsp finely ground earl grey (I found that this was equal to about 4tbsp of leaves before grinding)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup butter, softened
* 1/2 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tbsp grated orange zest

#### Method

Mix the flour, tea and salt together in a small bowl and set aside.
Beat the butter, sugar and orange zest together with an electric mixer
until the butter is fluffy. Slowly mix in the flour mixture until it
is all well-combined.

Form the dough into two long logs 3-4cm thick, and wrap them up in
baking paper. Put them in the fridge until the dough is firm enough
to cut (1 - 1.5 hours).

Preheat the oven to 180C, and line two baking trays with baking paper.
Cut the dough into thin biscuits and spread them out on the trays.
Bake for ~15 mins or until slightly golden. Leave to cool on a rack.

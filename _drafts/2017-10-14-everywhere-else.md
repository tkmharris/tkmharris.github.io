Some bits and pieces from all the other places I went this Summer.

## Glasgow
I went to Glasgow for three days of the British Combinatorial Conference directly after I returned to the U.K. from Iceland. I've heard great things about Glasgow's art museums and working class history, but I'll have to wait until I go again to find out more&mdash;this time I was too tired from traveling to do much of anything.

**Schedule:** Wake up, caf&eacute; for breakfast, go to conference, talk to people about books, watch some lectures, back to drop bag at hotel, cheapish restaurant for dinner, drink a couple of pints and read book in a pub, walk back drunk across Glasgow listening to local lads Mogwai's [Kids Will Be Skeletons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX8ebGCzGeo); getting those postrock Emotions. Sleep. Repeat x3.

## Montreal
I feel bad for not having more to say about Montr&eacute;al. I was vaguely obsessed with the city (or the idea of it) for a while in the late '00s, a feeling borne of my 17 year old self's obsession with the first *Arcade Fire* album[^1] and an ill-articulated desire to be somewhere *real*.

I was there for most of a week for the Mathematical Congress of the Americas. Perhaps I just didn't see the right parts of the city, never really straying far from  downtown, but I didn't thrill me. Some colleagues from the U.S. certainly liked it: doesn't Montr&eacute;al feel so European, they asked. No, not really. It felt like pretty much every other large North American city, except everybody smokes, some people speak French, and there are red lights and strip clubs everywhere.

The few times I did venture out of the downtown were a bit better. I spent an afternoon wandering around the old town, which actually does look European in a way few places in Europe do. (It feels artificial, sure, but it's still awfully pretty.) A caf&eacute; there made me a really delicious [London Fog](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:London_Fog).

Tim Horton's was good.[^2]

## Birmingham
Alright. Birmingham was a watchword for shit when I was young (No idea why, except: I grew up in a rural part of the countryside and Birmingham is culturally diverse. Make of that what you will.) Always surprised by how much I like it there, how down to eartn and friendly the people are.
Drank an awful lot. Featured in the 'Daily group theorist'

## Vienna

Here in v different circumstances. Am I different? Certainly, but also no? I would have laughed to imagine myself using the hotel gym & sauna (even if for me this was a bit perfomative, not what I usually do), then having a risotto & a nice glass of Riesling. But I didn't feel any different while I did it.

Swimming in the Danube: good. Sunburn: bad, but unavoidable unless you submit to spoiling the whole day with sun anxiety.

Met Tom from Masto. They were very nice and didn't murder me, so my mum was wrong about meeting people from the internet after all.

Hello, Robot ehibition at MAK: v good, very much my aesthetic. I think maybe I'm more into applied art than pure art now?

I've said before that I like being alone more than most people, but this has been too much travelling alone for me. I went to the prater, which should not be a solo trip. While I quite like eating alone, especially in Europe taking a book and eating at the bar, and I enjoy going to the cinema alone more now than I like going with others. Going on rollercoasters alone is a bridge too far though.

[^2]: **I can't believe I'm going to write a mini-essay on coffee**<br>It seems to me that the U.K. has chosen the worst possible coffee culture. Being, until recently, a nation of tea-drinkers, we have no coffee culture of our own and had to import somebody else's. To my consternation we seem to have settled for the U.S.'s premium mediocre Starbucks model, whole pints of milk and sugar. It's not even America's best coffee culture: Dunkin' Donts/Tim Horton's unpretentious "regular cup of Joe and a donut/Timbit" aesthetic is far superior, grounded at least in the memory of a real culture, something like Americana. Starbucks by contrast isn't really even authentically American in this sense. It's more Global.<br><br>The recent proliferation of independent Antipodean-owened caf&acute;s in London and slowly further afield, is at least drawing parts of the U.K. market away from the sugary-pint model, but it's coming in as a luxury consumer thing, highly-priced and lifestyle-focused, meeting places for the affluent. The coffee and food in these places is usually excellent, but I can't afford to stay and spend the whole afternoon reading, which is my primary use for caf&eacute;s.<br><br>I've always enjoyed caf&eacute;s in the Netherlands, and the few I went to in Stockholm this Summer were also pleasant, if unremarkable. I don't know if there's such a thing as "Northern European coffee culture" that the U.K. should try to emulate; more likely getting coffee in those places just isn't overtly American. I read the other day that Starbucks will soon open its first location in Italy: apparently the young people of Italy find its traditional coffee culture&mdash;romanticised the world over&mdash;staid and uncool. They too want volume.<br><br>Understand that it's not that I think how and where we drink our coffee is *important* in any real sense. It's just one more step in the slow homogenisation of everything. The dream of globalisation is that everybody has access to the best bits of all cultures. The reality is a double shot grand&eacute; skinny vanilla latt&eacute; for everyone. Bill Bryson once said that the main difference in England from when he moved here in the 70s is that we are a lot more American now. Since America is the dominant culture worldwide, theirs is the culture we all drift towards as globalisation takes hold. Now that the U.K. is untethering itself from the rest of Europe I predict this process will only accelerate. It makes me sad in a way I find difficult to articulate.

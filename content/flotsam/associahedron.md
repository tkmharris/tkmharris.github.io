Jean-Louis Loday's realisation of the (5-)[associahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron):

The vertices are generated from planar binary trees using the algorithm described in Loday's paper[^1] (Loday gives vertices in 4-space but they sit in a 3-dimsional hyperplane which I've projected onto ordinary 3-space). The surface was created and written to STL with the Trimesh Python library.

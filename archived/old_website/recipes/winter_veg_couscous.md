## Winter veg couscous

This recipe serves 3/4 people.

I stole it from Yotam Ottolenghi, which is why there are so many ingredients. Some can be left out. I didn't include the saffron threads from his original recipe because I'm not rich.

#### Ingredients

* 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
* 2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks
* 8 shallots, peeled and halved/quartered
* 2 cinnamon sticks (a few shakes of powder will work fine as well)
* 4 star anise (optional)
* 3 bay leaves (optional)
* 5 tbsp olive oil
* ½ tsp ground ginger
* ¼ tsp ground turmeric
* ¼ tsp hot paprika
* ¼ tsp chili flakes
* 300g pumpkin/butternut squash, peeled and cut into chunks
* 75g dried apricots, roughly chopped (optional)
* 400g can of chickpeas, with water (DO NOT drain)
* 200g (dry) couscous
* 300ml boiling veg stock
* ~50g harissa paste
* freshly chopped coriander (optional)
* salt and pepper to taste

#### Method

Preheat the oven to 190°C. Put the carrots, parsnips and shallots in a large ovenproof dish. Add the cinnamon, star anise, bay leaves, oil, ¾ teaspoon salt, and all the other spices and mix well. Place in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.

Add the pumpkin/squash and return to the oven. Cook for another 35 or until the vegetables have softened reasonably while retaining a bite. Now add the dried apricots and chickpeas with their water, stir around, and cook for a further 15 minutes or until it looks done.

About 15 minutes before the veg is done, put the couscous in a large heatproof bowl with a little oil and ½ teaspoon salt. Pour in the veg stock, and cover and leave for 10 minutes. Then fluff up the couscous and stir in the harissa paste.

To serve, spoon the couscous onto a bowl or plate and spoon the
vegetables onto the couscous. Finish with chopped coriander if desired.

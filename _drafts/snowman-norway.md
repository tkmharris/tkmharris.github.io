*The Snowman* is okay. Some good actors hampered by a bad script. Nothing exceptional, but a solid couple of hours of Scandinavian Noir, which I like.

Films shot in English are really jarring when they come with a strong sense of place; I'd prefer to watch this in Norwegian with subtitles. The Kiling&mdash;fine in Danish, had to be remade for U.S.

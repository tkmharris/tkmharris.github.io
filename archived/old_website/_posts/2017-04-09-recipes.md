I can't think of anything good to write about this week, I'm afraid. I've had a weekend filled with minor frustrations, but writing them down doesn't seem like it would be helpful for me or interesting for anybody else. So instead here are some of my regular recipes, in case you wanted to try something new.

* [Banana oat biscuits](/recipes/banana_oat_biscuits/)
* [Carrot, squash, and ginger soup](/recipes/carrot_squash_ginger_soup/)
* [Celeriac remoulade](/recipes/celeriac_remoulade/)
* [Cheesy tomato risotto](/recipes/cheesy_tomato_risotto/)
* [Earl Grey biscuits](/recipes/earl_grey_biscuits/)
* [Mackerel, potato, and radish salad](/recipes/mackerel_salad/)
* [Mushroom and squash risotto](/recipes/squash_mushroom_risotto/)
* [Sweet chili tofu with sticky rice](/recipes/sweet_chili_tofu_rice/)

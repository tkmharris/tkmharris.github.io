## Celeriac remoulade

Serves 3/4 people as a starter.

#### Ingredients

* 7 tbsp good quality mayonnaise.
* 3 tbsp Dijon mustard.
* Juice of 1 lemon.
* 1 small celeriac, ~650g.
* Toast and watercress, to serve.


#### Method

Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, and lemon juice together in a large bowl with a sprinkling of salt and ground black pepper, so it all becomes one sauce.

Peel and quarter the celeriac, then quickly grate it coarsely and stir it into the sauce until evenly coated. Serve with toast and plenty of watercress.

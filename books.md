Works read in translation are marked with a dagger (&dagger;).
Things I read for book club are marked with a tilde (&#126;)

### <a name="2019"></a>2019

1. **Bridget Jones's Diary**, Helen Fielding.  
Mixed feelings on this one. On the one hand, richly observed & v. funny. On the other, I don't think I've ever read a more Tory book.

2. **Gef! The Strange Tale of an Extra-Special Talking Mongoose**, Christopher Josiffe.  
Truly weird and oddly funny. I'm delighted this book exists but wish it were about half as long.

3. **Convenience Store Woman**, Sayaka Murata. &dagger; (Japanese)  
Darkly funny.

4. **Levels of Life**, Julian Barnes.  
Deeply moving. A marvelous book.

5. **Faceless Killers**, Henning Mankell. &dagger; (Swedish)  
Solid crime. Unexpectedly untwisty.

6. **The Talented Mr Ripley**, Patricia Highsmith.  
Even before his murderous turn, Ripley is a fantastic portrait of insecurity.  

7. **Winter**, Ali Smith. &#126;  
The second volume in Smith's ongoing state of the nation project. Effective, but relies on the same tropes as earlier Smith books.

8. **Seven Brief Lessons on Physics**, Carlo Rovelli.  
I can see why it's popular, but that's rather little content.

9. **Autumn**, Ali Smith.  
Skippingback to Smith's first volume. Much less engaging for me.


### <a name="2018"></a>2018

1. **Longitude**, Dava Sobel.  

2. **A Doubter's Almanac**, Ethan Canin.  
I read this to see if I agree with [Charles' review](/assets/files/a-doubters-almanac-LMS-review.pdf). I don't.  

3. **Swing Time**, Zadie Smith. &#126;  
The first book at the book club I started with some work pals. I thought it was great, others disagreed. Which is what you want from a book club I suppose.  

4. **Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen**, Douglas Adams & James Goss.  
A long-lost Fourth Doctor & Romana script that Adams later recycled bits of into *Life, the Universe and Everything*, completed to a full novel by Goss. Bonkers, naturally.  

5. **How Not To Be a Boy**, Robert Webb.  
Either a thoughtful reflection on masculinity disguised as a celebrity hardback, or a celebrity hardback disguised as a thoughtful reflection on masculinity, depending on how generous you're feeling.

6. **On the Natural History of Destruction**, W. G. Sebald.  

7. **The Vegetarian**, Han Kang. &#126;, &dagger; (Korean)  
Remarkably readable short novel on madness, hunger and familial violence. Visceral, sensuous and disturbing; I really liked it.

8. **Educated**, Tara Westover.  
Memoir of Westover's journey from Idaho survivalist Mormon school-less childhood to Cambridge PhD. I don't think the author and I would agree who the villain of her story is.

9. **If I'm Scared We Can't Win: Penguin modern poets 1**, Emily Berry, Anne Carson & Sophie Collins.  
Lots of good stuff in here, but Emily Berry's work in particular is great.

10. **The Bend of the World**, Jacob Bacharach.  
tired: reading the *Chapo* book;
wired: reading other  books because their authors were funny on *Chapo*.

11. **Eileen**, Ottessa Moshfegh. &#126;  

12. **Politics and the English Language**, George Orwell.
More of a pamphet than a book.

13. **Sight**, Jessie Greengrass.  
Greengrass's first novel lives up to expectations. Some words [here](http://tkmh.space/2018/04/25/sight-jessie-greengrass/).  

14. **H(A)PPY**, Nicola Barker.  &#126;  
I really enjoyed the first half of this but it lost me after a while. More [here](http://tkmh.space/2018/05/27/h%28a%29ppy/).

15. **Injection #1**, W. Ellis, D. Shalvey & J. Bellaire.  

16. **Possession**, A. S. Byatt.  
It inspired me to finally buy the letters of Abelard and Heloise. We'll see if I actually read them.

17. **On Chesil Beach**, Ian McEwan. &lowast;  
My favourite McEwan. Re-read before going to see the film.

18. **Shutter Island**, Dennis Lehane.  

19. **Stand Out of Our Light: freedom and resistance in the attention economy**, James Williams.  
The book of the Nine Dots prize-winning essay. Didn't deliver on its promise in my opinion.

20. **Philosophy of Mathematics**, Øystein Linnebo.  
Very clear and readable introduction.

21. **The Island of Doctor Moreau**, H. G. Wells. &#126;  
*Crash Bandicoot* rip-off.  

22. **The Idiot**, Elif Batuman.  
Excellent. Funny and wise.

23. **Ada Lovelace: the making of a computer scientist**, Christopher Hollings, Ursula Martin, Adrian Rice.  
Bought at Topping & Co. in St Andrews during the BMC. Ursula was a good sport and signed my copy.

24. **Bit of a Blur**, Alex James.  
Poolside fodder.

25. **Infinity to Dine**, lazenby.  
Essays by one of the *The Relentless Picnic* guys. Lunchtime reading for the past month.

26. **Essays on the Theory of Numbers**, Richard Dedekind. &dagger; (German)  
Where modern maths began.

27. **Dracula**, Bram Stoker. &#126;  

28. **Computation, Proof, Machine**, Giles Dowek. &dagger; (French)  

29. **Men Without Women**, Haruki Murakami. &dagger; (Japanese)  

30. **The Glass Bead Game**, Hermann Hesse. &dagger; (German)  
Fantastic, going on my all-time favourites list.

31. **Lullaby**, Leïla Slimani. &dagger; (French) &#126;  
Very readable. Does its thing well.

32.  **Game Theory**, Thomas Jones.  
Amusing, but hardly the cutting satire it was reviewed as.

33. **Let's Explore Diabetes With Owls**, David Sedaris.  
Extremely funny. Best taken sparingly, like sweets.

34. **Letters written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark**, Mary Wollstonecraft.  

35. **Normal People**, Sally Rooney. &#126;  
Excellent. Has some of the best description of depression (as I've experienced it) I've ever read. 

36. **Closing the Gap**, Vicky Neale.  
Pop maths: background on the twin prime conjecture interwoven with the story of the advances of Zhang, Maynbard, Tao and the polymath group. Started well but petered out a little in my opinion.

37. **Tintin: The Black Island**, Hergé. &dagger; (French)  
Never read any Tintin before. This one didn't have Captain Haddock in it, which was a great disappointment. I bought the one with the boat on the cover expecting him.

38. **The Red-Haired Woman**, Orhan Pamuk. &dagger; (Turkish)  
Spellbinding.

39. **The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle**, Stuart Turton.  
Inventive murder-mystery, but ultimately doesn't make the most of its premise.

40. **33⅓: OK Computer**, Dai Griffiths.  
I probably won't read another one of these.  

41. **Wise Children**, Angela Carter.  
Unbelievably bawdy. Great fun.  

42. **Mr Burns: a post-electric play**, Anne Washburn.  

43. **Conversations with Friends**, Sally Rooney.  
Just as fantastic as *Normal People*.  

44. **Coyote America**, Dan Flores.  

45. **Picture-Book Professors: academia and children's literature**, Melissa M. Terras.  

46. **Carol**, Patricia Highsmith.  
Lovely.  


### <a name="2017"></a>2017

1. **Neoreaction a Basilisk**, Phil Sandifer.  

2. **I Hate the Internet**, Jarett Kobek.  
276 pages of caustic rage directed at rich technologists.

3. **Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic**, Anita & Solomon Feferman.  

4. **A Winter Book**, Tove Jansson. &dagger; (Swedish)

5. **The Fish Ladder**, Katharine Norbury.  
A potentially-interesting nature book ruined by the author's unbearable narcissism.

6. **Orkneyinga Saga**, Anonymous. &dagger; (Old Norse)  
The saga of the Earls of Orkney from 950ish to 1200ish. Part history, part legend, [frequently unintentionally hilarious](http://tkmh.space/2017/03/02/orkneyinga-saga/).

7. **Fingersmith**, Sarah Waters.  

8. **The Secret History**, Donna Tartt.  

9. **Beyond the Northlands**, Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough.  

10. **A Tale for the Time Being**, Ruth Ozeki.  
I heard about this on the [Overdue podcast](http://overduepodcast.com/) so I knew some of the story in advance. A meditation of sorts on time and suffering, but wrapped up in a flowing story. Its comparisons between Zen Buddhism and quantum physics irked me no end (as always). Otherwise very good.

11. **Zero K**, Don Delillo.  

12. **Wild**, Cheryl Strayed.  

13. **The Housekeeper and the Professor**, Yoko Ogawa. &dagger; (Japanese)  
Novella about a mathematician with an 80 minute memory, his housekeeper, and her son. Includes some simple, but correct, maths and is mostly non-embarrassing for the mathematically-trained to read.

14. **Concepts of Modern Mathematics**, Ian Stewart.  
The maths book I wish somebody had given me when I was 18. Explains the ideas behind various parts of modern maths in a non-technical but also not-empty manner.

15. **June**, Gerbrand Bakker. &dagger; (Dutch)  

16. **Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency**, Douglas Adams.  

17. **The Descent of Man**, Grayson Perry.  
Short collection of Perry's thoughts on masculinity and how it needs to be updated. Not a deep analysis, but a good introduction for the curious.

18. **Silas Marner**, George Eliot.  

19. **Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit**, Jeanette Winterson.  

20. **Against Everything**, Mark Greif.  
I got this book of essays I went to see Mark Greif interviewed by Laurie Penny at the *LRB* bookshop at the end of last year. I must have underlined at least one sentence per page, Greif is a hell of a writer.

21. **Kill All Normies**, Angela Nagle.  
I failed to review this [here](http://tkmh.space/2017/09/05/kill-all-normies/).

22. **The Blue Fox**, Sj&oacute;n. &dagger; (Icelandic)

23. **Do No Harm**, Henry Marsh.

24. **Heroes of the Frontier**, Dave Eggers.  
I love Dave Eggers. His books don't always work as a completed whole for me, but I never tire of how alive his line-by-line writing is.

25. **In Watermelon Sugar**, Richard Brautigan.  

26. **Between the World and Me**, Ta-Nehisi Coates.  

27. **His Bloody Project**, Graham Burnett Macrae.  

28. **The Goldfinch**, Donna Tartt.  
I couldn't stop reading this. Utterly brilliant.

29. **Leviathan, or the Whale**, Philip Hoare.

30. **Northern Lights**, Phillip Pullman. &lowast;  

31. **The Subtle Knife**, Phillip Pullman. &lowast;  

32. **The Amber Spyglass**, Phillip Pullman. &lowast;  

33. **La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Vol. I**, Phillip Pullman.  
I was so relieved it's not a terrible disappointment that it took me quite a while to realise it's really good!

34. **Every Last Tie: The Story of the Unabomber and His Family**, David Kaczynski.  
Interesting and moving, but ultimately unsatisfying as Kaczynski isn't interested in telling the stories the reader most wants to hear.

35. **The Fellowship of the Ring**, J. R. R. Tolkein. &lowast;  

36. **The Two Towers**, J. R. R. Tolkein. &lowast;  

37. **The Return of the King**, J. R. R. Tolkein. &lowast;  
Re-read these for the first time in 15 years while I was feeling ill and sorry for myself in November.

38. **Letters from Iceland**, W. H. Auden & Louis MacNeice.  
Unconventional travel book written in a mix of prose and verse.

39. **Scoop**, Evelyn Waugh.  

40. **A Very British Coup**, Chris Mullin.  

### <a name="2016"></a>2016

the crossword**, Alan Connor.

This third volume covers Knausg&#229;rd's life up to
age 12 or so on the island of Trom&oslash;ya.

Collection the author's '2d goggles' comic strips
about the alternate-universe adventures of Ada Lovelace and

Wittgenstein lived a beautiful life.

9. **A303: the Highway to the Sun**, Tom Fort.  

10. **We Have Always Lived in the Castle**, Shirley Jackson.  
I wonder why so much gothic horror is set in New England?
*(edit: one-word answer suggested by Emilio Pierro -- "Puritans")*

11. **Siddhartha**, Hermann Hesse. &dagger; (German)  

12. **The Outrun**, Amy Liptrot.  
Stark and moving memoir of the author's return to Orkney and recovery
from alcoholism.

13. **Station Eleven**, Emily StJohn Mandel.  

14. **The Winter's Tale**, William Shakespeare.  
This was not my favourite Shakespeare play.

22. **Public Library (and other stories)**, Ali Smith.  

23. **The Shpeherd's Life**, James Rebanks.  

24. **An Account of the Decline of the Great Auk, According to One Who Saw It**, Jessie Greengrass.  
Really good debut collection of short stories. The title story is the standout.

26. **Prime Numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis**, Barry Mazur & William Stein.  

27. **Aurora**, Kim Stanley Robinson.

32. **The Girl in the Spider's Web**, David Lagercrantz.  

33. **Littlewood's Miscellany**, J. E. Littlewood.

43. **The Wee Free Men**, Terry Practchett. &lowast;  


### <a name="2015"></a>2015

1. **Ayoade on Ayoade: a cinematic odyssey**, Richard Ayoade.  
Very, very funny. Did you know Werner Herzog is too self-conscious to eat Wiener
Hotdogs?

2. **My Struggle 1: a death in the family**, Karl Ove Knausg&#229;rd. &dagger; (Norwegian)  
The first volume of Knausg&#229;rd's autobiographical cycle.
It's brutally honest and incredibly good.

3. **Good Omens**, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.  

4. **A View from the Foothills: the diaries of Chris Mullin 1999-2005**.  

5. **The Buried Giant**, Kazuo Ishiguro.  

6. **Lords and Ladies**, Terry Pratchett. &lowast;  
My favourite Pratchett book as a child, re-read after he died.

7. **So You've Been Publicly Shamed**, Jon Ronson.  

8. **Landmarks**, Robert Macfarlane.  
A celebration of MacFarlane's favourite nature writers.
Enjoyable, but not of the same standard as MacFarlane's *The Old Ways*.

9. **The Cyberiad**, Stanis&#x142;aw Lem. &dagger; (Polish)  
Excelelnt translation.

10. **Lightning Rods**, Helen DeWitt.  

11. **In the All-Night Caf&eacute;**, Stuart David.  

12. **Foundation**, Isaac Asimov. &lowast;
13. **Foundation and Empire**, Isaac Asimov.
14. **Second Foundation**, Isaac Asimov.  

15. **This Changes Everything**, Naomi Klein.  
A rigorous discussion of the problem of climate change in a
liberal capitalist world. Frankly this made me pretty despondent for the future.

16. **Cakes, Custard, and Category Theory,** Eugenia Cheng.  
I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this very much,
I found it hard to distinguish from other pop-maths books.

17. **My Struggle 2: a man in love**, Karl Ove Knausg&#229;rd. &dagger; (Norwegian)  
Even better than the first volume.

18. **North**, Seamus Heaney.  

19. **Alan Turing: the Enigma**, Andrew Hodges.  
The gold standard for a scientific biography. Rather technical in places.

20. **The Innocence of Father Brown**, G. K. Chesterton.  

21. **A Room with a View**, E. M. Forster. &lowast;  
A re-read of an old favourite.

22. **Purity**, Jonathan Franzen.  

23. **Decline and Fall: the diaries of Chris Mullin 2005-2010**.  

24. **Everything and More**,
David Foster Wallace.  
A spirited attempt to write an interesting lay person's history of the
mathematics of the transfinite. Contains some pretty huge maths blunders.

25. **Last Night in Montreal**, Emily St.John Mandel.  

26. **The Way of the Runner**, Adharanand Finn.  

27. **The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**, Stieg Larsson. &dagger; (Swedish)

28. **The Girl who Played with Fire**, Stieg Larsson. &dagger; (Swedish)

29. **The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest**, Stieg Larsson. &dagger; (Swedish)  
I didn't read these during the hype period of about a decade ago.
Suffice to say they were as gripping as expected.

30. **The Lady in the Van**, Alan Bennett. &lowast;  

31. **The Road to Little Dribbling**, Bill Bryson.  

32. **Not That Kind of Girl**, Lena Dunham.  

33. **Look Who's Back**, Timur Vermes. &dagger; (German)

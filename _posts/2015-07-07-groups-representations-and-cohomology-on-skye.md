A couple of weeks ago I attended a summer school on the Isle of Skye, organised
by the Anglo-Franco-German representation theory network. The aim of the school
was to understand the following theorem of Benson, Carlson, and Rickard: that
thick tensor ideals of the stable module category of a finite group are
classified by the specialisation closed subsets of the projective variety
associated with the cohomology ring of the group.
In particular we studied a [new proof](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6536) of this
theorem due to Carlson and Iyengar.

This topic was a little way away from my usual research, but I found it
enormously interesting. What is most fascinating is how much has been achieved
in this field with homological algebra. I understand that this has been in part
through necessity:
> *There is a legendary story that Brauer, himself, used to advise his students
> not to try to study the representation theory of p-groups. The subject
> seemed to be too difficult with little or no promise of productive results.
> Yet for the investigation of module structure, many of the most fascinating
> and difficult problems can be easily reduced to questions involving the
> representations of p-groups over fields of characteristic p.
> On the other hand, in this situation, all group characters are trivial, the
> Grothendieck group is trivial, and many of the classical techniques of
> representation theory have no relevance.
> The only method left open to us is homological algebra*.[^1]

In any case, I now have one more reason to get to work learning about
triangulated and derived worlds.

Of course, one can't go to Skye and only do maths! I travelled to the summer
school by the most beautiful possible route: conventional trains to Edinburgh
and from Edinburgh to Glasgow; the famous, and absolutely stunning, West
Highland Line from Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort William, which skirts Loch Lomond
and crosses the
[Glenfinnan viaduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenfinnan_Viaduct);
finally, the breezy ferry crossing from Mallaig to Armadale.
Registration for the summer school didn't start until the day after I arrived,
so I took advantage of Scotland's freedom to roam, and wild camped the night.
It was cold and I got ticks. The next day I warmed up at the Talisker distillery
before heading back to register at the Gaelic college where the summer school
was being hosted.

The rest of the week was quite busy, but I managed to fit in some more
successful outdoorsing. On the free afternoon I went with three others to climb
a nearby mountain, Beinn na Cailleach.
It has an
especially large summit cairn, reputedly the burial site of a Norwegian
princess:
> *...the cairn situated on the summit of Beinn na Cailleach, not far from
> Broadford... This cairn is believed to mark the site of burial of a Norse
> princess who died at Ord. On her deathbed this princess commanded her
> attendants to convey her, when dead to the top of Beinn na Cailleach,
> and to bury her there, in order that she might lie in the wake of the winds
> from Norway*.[^2]

Another evening I led a small group on a shorter walk to
see some waterfalls. We swam in a loch and then got lost on the way back.
Luckily it is light almost until midnight in June on Skye, so we could at least
see where we were going. And during a couple of lunchtimes I went down to a
beach to swim (very briefly) in the sea. It was much colder than the loch!

Skye is fantastically beautiful, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to
go. I'll definitely be going back, hopefully for a holiday so I have more time
to explore.

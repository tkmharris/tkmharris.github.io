Some short words about A Doubter's almanac and the difficulties with maths fiction.
Most of this has been said already by DFW. 
This gets the background pretty close to right (apart from a few clunkers - the Abel prize before 30).
This is close to a successful maths novel than either reviewed by Wallace: because really it's not about maths.

But, is a successful maths novel possible? What would be the point? The audience is vanishingly small.

you can't actually learn anything, it should be more like the princeton companion (but not written by experts), or the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.
Note: I'm very conscious of the long history of debate over what wikipedia is and what it is not. 
Suffice to say there are inclusionists and exclusionists. 
I think my problem is not contained in that line, but nor is it orthogonal.

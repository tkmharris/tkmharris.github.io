I deleted facebook on New Year's Day 2017. I miss it. Or rather, I don't miss it -- as a service it's okay and as a company it might be the very worst on earth -- but I miss the function it serves. It's the one social network I confidently expect almost everybody I interact with to use, and I have missed out on things I'd like to know about by not having it. I don't really think the latest scandal will change anything, I think we're fucked as a culture. The privacy concerns aren't going to make many people quit; they aren't even what made me quit. But now I have quit it seems impossible to rejoin. It's one thing to be a frog in slowly boiling water, another to dive headfirst into the frothing pot.

add: tinder account, , masto twitter insta, ideal social network for fully-automated &c. &c., hard to feel optiomistic, talking politics links

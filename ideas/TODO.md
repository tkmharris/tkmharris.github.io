# TODOs for tkmh.space

* choose a good base theme and tweak to my satisfaction
	- find out how to create different image classes in markdown https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/
	- decide whether I want to have everything on one page, Mu-An style, or to stick with the navbar style (try both?)
* PROOFREAD
* make favicon (t k m h in a square, colours chosen to match final design)
* get working on github pages and set up deploy.sh
* get svg icons working 
	- should just appear inline with, e.g., {{% svg-icons twitter %}} but they don't

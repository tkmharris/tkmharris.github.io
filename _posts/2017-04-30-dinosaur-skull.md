For all the talk of draining the swamp, a fair number of older establishment Republicans who took a gamble on Donald Trump are now being rewarded in office. In recent months the *London Review of Books* has been promoting pieces from its archive[^1] on the past exploits of these various deplorables. Something in particular that caught my eye was [this 1995 review](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v17/n16/christopher-hitchens/newtopia) by Christopher Hitchens of a book by Newt Gingrich, then Speaker of the House. It's nice to be reminded of what a remarkable writer Hitchens was, whatever his personal and ideological faults.

Here's Hitchens on Gingrich's habit of bringing up dinosaurs at every opportunity:

> Still, are we supposed to dislike a writer with such a boyish love for dinosaurs? These great lizards are to Gingrich a sort of King Charles’s Head: he can’t keep them out of the narrative. Recently, when he found the tempestuous Melanie Griffith in a House corridor (she was there to lobby against the cancellation of funding for public television and the arts: another joint Gingrich-Murdoch enterprise), the Speaker crept up and asked ‘Would you like to see my dinosaur?’ He has a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull in his office. He has a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull in his *skull*: ‘Just list some of the changes we are living through: laptop computers, cellular telephones, molecular medicine, new discoveries about the dinosaurs, home security systems that talk, composite materials that make cars lighter, micro-engineering, manufacturing in space, high definition television, the video store – the list goes on and on.’

*He has a Tyrannosaurus Rex skull in his skull*, what a gorgeous line. I've been trying to get better at writing lately, but I know I'll never be able to write like that. There's a lot more to good writing than the odd great line of course, but I'd sure be pleased to write something like that every now and again.

[^1]: Most of the archive is only available to *LRB* subscribers, but these promoted pieces are free. The archive is a wonderful bonus if you are a subscriber, there's some brilliant stuff in there.

<!-- About how Halloween is tacky as hell, but Autumn is great. Also about England and America -->

Has there ever been such a gulf between an aesthetic's potential and realisation as Halloween?

<!-- 
To include:
* It's decorative gourd season motherfuckers
* This aesthetic more plainly realised in the US than here: the New England Fall Colours
* Michal's complanit about people doing Halloween in the Czech Republic, which has its own day of the dead.
* The US Halloween culture now appropriates [careful here] Mexico's
* Guy Fawke's night is a cool aesthetic, except for the acid rain and religious violence.

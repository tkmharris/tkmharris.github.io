Yesterday I raced in the Salisbury half marathon, which I've been training for for the last three months.
I lost my GPS watch while traveling to Salisbury, so I had to make do with a stopwatch and the mile markers to gague my pace.
I finished in 39th place, in a time of 1:30:10.
I'm a bit disappointed to have missed going under 90 minutes by so little, but since my previous best was over four minutes slower I'm pretty happy.

I was in a meeting a couple of weeks ago in which my team at the company I work received an update on how our products have been selling over the last six months. Until a couple of years ago I knew nothing about this kind of thing at all, and to be honest I'm still relatively in the dark. One thing that was easy to learn though was that for a company like ours, how your sales look depends in a large part on how your relationship with Amazon is going.

This presents a problem for the sales people, because Amazon is opaque. It's a common trope to think of organisations above a certain size as like minds, their decision-making takes place at a level of abstraction above easily-understood business logic; outcomes are determined by numerous inter-related factors firing in patterns. This is even more true of Amazon. The sheer range of things they sell and the ways they sell them mean that global policy can easily dominate local sense, TODO. What's more, the rapid turnover of their workforce strips away the reassurance of a fixed point of human contact through whom to get reliable communications of policy in the first place.

For this reason, the comparison that's always sprung to mind when I have to go to these meetings is of a Seer trying to gauge the mind of a powerful and capricious  spirit. Amazon isn't completely unknowable, but nor does it think as we expect it might. Seeing it is an art, but with the right leaves and by burning the right spices one can get a handle on definite truths.[^1]

Anyway, in this particular meeting the sales people were very happy: Amazon's ordering for January was nearly double what it had been the previous year. They couldn't explain why, but they weren't unduly worried: nobody fears the peaceful spirit. The interesting part is not the Amazon people couldn't answer when our sales people did ask why they were suddenly buying so much more, but rather why they couldn't. Not because no one person has control of all the policy and needs, but because nobody at all at Amazon can aswer this question now, even in theory. Amazon has turned over demand planning to machine learning algorithms.[^2]



[^1] The other metaphor I turn to is an abusive relationship, but let's keep things plausibly professional here.

[^2] the person explaining this to us said: I don't know, I expect you guys understand this a lot better than me, but the gist is that algorithms write their algorithms. I declined to correct him.

When asked to justify their research on abstract structures, many mathematicians will reply with some form of the argument from future utility. "Sure, semiperfect Andret complexes have no application right now" they might say,[^1] "but the history of science is littered with instances of pure mathematics developed with no real-world application in mind turning out to be the perfect description of some physical phenomenon".

And the thing is they're not wrong. The most famous example, the one you're most likely to have quoted at you, is of Bernhard Riemann's work on curved spaces (now called [Riemmanian geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry)). Working out the details of the mathematics of curved surfaces (such as a sphere), done by others before Riemann, was by no means easy, but it was at least justified by surfaces seen immersed in three-dimensional space in the real world. Riemann's great leap to conceive of spaces of three dimensions and more that are also intrinsically curved in the same ways a sphere is was mathematics in its purest form. But some 60 years later, in his celebrated theory of general relativity, Einstein successfully described gravity as a curvature of space and time using exactly the ideas developed by Riemann and those following him.

But this is not the only example: time and time again something developed for the sake of it turns out to be the right tool for some piece of science. the representation theory of groups explains the vibrations of certain molecules in terms of their symmetries. Analysis of [finite geometries](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-finitegeometries) is key for developing optimal error-correcting codes. Second most famously, after Riemann and Einstein, number theory (either in an elementary form as modular arithmetic or the more sophisticated arithmetic of elliptic curves over finite fields) is the foundation of all modern cryptography, despite G. H. Hardy's confident assertions in *A Mathematician's Apology* that the theory of numbers was the purest of the pure and would never affect the world either positively or negatively as the cruder sciences would (this does give the *Apology* a certain bathos).

And yet I've never really believed this defense of pure mathematics, and I don't believe its adherents do either, really. The amount of maths that turns out to be useful is surprisingly large, but the amount of maths in total is many times vaster. Most of it does not and will not ever be applied outside of mathematics itself. People know this, but many seem not to want to admit it. I was in the audience for a panel discussion at the weekend on "Is God a Mathematician?" (I know, horrible title/topic, but the discussion was good), and it was refreshing to hear Kevin Buzzard say outright

>Oh yeah, from the point of view of the real word all the maths I do is a load of old rubbish. Ninety-nine percent of what my department produces is useless.[^2], [^3]

I can understand people's desire to believe and promote the eventually-applicable view. The teasing hope that understanding derived categories of Calabi-Yau manifolds will eventually lead us to the correct form of string theory certainly helps raise grant money. But mathematicians for the most part aren't motivated by the hope that their work will eventually be useful&mdash;they do it for the fun of it, to satisfy their own curiosity. Utility is a bonus. In this one sense pure mathematics is much more like an art or the humanities than a science. I don't say this to demean mathematics (or the arts and humanities, come to that): I just think we should be honest about why we do things and who they're for. And then, because we know deep down that pure mathematicians' universities pay them to teach and tolerate their research so far as it raises their department's reputation, and because we are happy with this arrangement and want it to continue, we should extend the same privilege to those in the humanities and arts and anybody else who wants to create for a living.

[^1]:  ("beyond their *obvious* importance for the finite characteristic case of the automorphism tower collapse conjecture")

[^2]: Not a precise quote&mdash;not quick enough to record&mdash;but close enough.

[^3]: Buzzard is refreshingly forthright in general; in answer to a question about whether absolute infinity causes a fundamental incompatibility between idealised mathematics and the real world: "Oh, infinity? Yeah we just made it up."

This June, after travelling to Reykjavík for work and [a little bit of tourism](/2017/07/09/reykjavik/), I spent the better part of a week hiking in the Iceland's Southern highlands. I have some experience of mountain walking (solo and in small groups), but this was the first big trip I've done on my own. I'm happy to say that it went really well, I had a great time. The trails I walked&mdash;Laugavegur, a daywalk around Þórsmörk, and the Skógar trail over Fimmvörðuháls&mdash;are all absurdly scenic. If you're into hinking, and you have the time and resources, I really recommend taking this trip. The walks themselves are not very challenging and could be completed by anybody healthy and not too unfit.

That said, the weather is very variable in the interior of Iceland and the trails come with lots of warnings. I was lucky and had generally good weather, but it is important to take the advice of the wardens. In the weeks before my trip, when I started to think seriously about my kit and provisions, I made myself pretty anxious reading the very stern safety notices and the horror stories of calamnaties that have befallen other walkers on these paths. Somebody dies here every other year[^1] and many more are evacuated with hypothermia. The wind and rain can be pretty brutal, and on the high passes it can become very hard to navigate in the fog. Blizzard white-outs are not uncommon and people routinely get lost and caught out in the weather and have to be rescued.

Before I went I feared I had taken on too much. Perhaps I should have done a similar multi-day solo trip somewhere safer and less remote, or instead done this trip with a friend? But by this point I had spent quite a lot of money, I had told a lot of people I was going, and anyway, what was I, a man or a mouse? So I went down to the outdoors shop and spent more money than I could afford on equiptment: new overtrousers, merino base layers for top and bottom, a thick scarf, biovac emergency bag, extensible walking pole for safely crossing rivers, and a handheld GPS device. I also rented an emergency radio locator beacon in Reykjavík to take with me, so if the absoutely worst happened and I got completely lost and started suffering from hypothermia, I could put all my clothes on, climb into my biovac bag, set off the beacon and wait to be rescued.[^2]

So, reassured at least that I wasn't going to die, I got up early one typical drizzly morning in Reykjavík, shouldered my bag full of equiptment and food (mainly oats, pasta, and tinned fish), and walked down to the station to catch the bus to [Landmannalaugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmannalaugar).

#### Landmannalaugar

The bus journey was not encouraging. The landscape got rapidly more forbidding and the weather deteriorated quickly. After an a couple of hours driving on the ring road towards  the South of the island we turned off of regular highways altogether and headed onto bumpy, jarring mountain mountain roads. At one point the bus stopped to allow us out to stretch our legs and take in a glacial river. Everybody else seemed comfortable and excited; I was shivering and afraid. The river was the bright eerie blue of seriously cold meltwater. It looked like a grave.

From that stop it was another hour along decreasingly road-like roads to Landmannalaugar. I'd been regularly checking the Ferðafélag Íslands ([Icelandic Hiking Association](https://www.fi.is/en)) Facebook page in the preceding weeks, and I was glad to see that the snow covering Landmannalaugar had finally melted. Everything was damp, but at least pretty green:

The first trail I was going to walk was the [Laugavegur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugavegur), which runs 55 very varied km from Landmannalaugar to Þórsmörk. Since we were due to arrive in Landmannalaugar at 1pm, my plan had been to do just a short section of the trail on the first afternoon, 4.5 hours uphill to the FI Hut at the pass at Hrafntinnusker. By the time we arrived though it was clear that it wasn't a good day for walking. The rain was like bullets and my coat was no match, I was extremely cold and damp within a few minutes of being outside. I went to the information hut and they told me that the weather reports from Hrafntinnusker (another 400m higher up and still covered in snow) were sufficiently worrying that the wardens were "strongly advising" walkers to stay the night at Landmannalaugar. So I dropped off my bag in the dorm room in the hut and settled in for the afternoon.[^3]

Besides being the start point of the Laugavegur (and numerous other walks in the area), Landmannalaugar is famous for its hot springs&mdash;"Landmannalaugar" loosely translates as "The Common Man's Pools". I had planned to just take a look at the pools before starting out, but since I was delayed for the day I was able to take a dip. That meant walking the 100m to the springs outside in the driving rain in my trunks, but I fugured the water would make up for it. Most people I suppose, when they think of hot springs in Iceland, think of the [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com/) or similar; the pools at Landmannalaugar are a little less fancy:
![Landmannalaugar hot springs](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar-springs.jpg){:.center width="90%"}
I later found out that the nice even temperature you get at the Blue Lagoon is not an accident: the whole thing was purpose built as a tourist attraction. It turns out real hot springs aren't lovely bathwater rising from the ground. Instead there is a freezing cold river and a few springs of literally boiling water spewing out from underground into it. One sits on the gravelly riverbed and tries to find a position where the hot and cold mix to a bearable medium, getting periodicallly burned or too cold as the wind and currents change. Which is not to say I didn't like it, but it wasn't the luxury experience I had anticipated. I stayed in for about an hour though, huddled around the springs like penguins with the other bathers, trying to ignore the rain in our eyes. It was an experience anyway. When I got out I realised somebody had mistakenly taken my towel and I had to make my way back shivering violently in the rain. It seems a bit ridiculous to say now, but at the time I felt like I understood, physicaly for the first time, how easy it would be to die of cold.

I whiled away most of the rest of the day reading a book on my ereader (*Silas Marner* &ndash; George Eliot) and exchanging nervous pleasantries with other hikers. Some were clearly old hands, but others seemed no more serious about it than me. A large guided tour group of twenty or so (mostly) Americans were in high spirits, presumably because they were paying not to have to worry (or cook their own meals; I felt very uncharitable to these people all week). As far as I could tell, there was only one other solo hiker staying in the hut, a Canadian woman caled Amy. She told me she had also been forced to delay her start, but wasn't planning to do a double stage the next day. Most of the oters were small groups of 2,3 or 4 people who seemd about as prepared as me, but less nervous (perhaps from experience). This was only my impression of the eople in the huts though; the people camping outside seemed like a much hardier folk. I admired them, but I was extremely pleased to have chosen to fork out the £50 a night for the huts rather than camp in this place. The accomodation in the hut was pretty basic&mdash;your £50 buys a matress in a dorm room for 20 and access to a shared kitchen and bathroom&mdash;but the campsite wasa world away from my experience:

Quite spread out, so I was lucky to catch up a couple of workers just in time to get a pictture in the world's best posing spot.

#### Day 4: Daywalk around Þórsmörk, including Rjúpnafell

![Crag](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day4-crag.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

just like in English, Icelandic uses *fell* to mean a small mountain. The Icelandic word for proper-sized mountains is *Fjall* (or *Fjöll* in the plural[^4]).

I was surprised when to discover I had 3G when I got to the top, so I seized the opportunity to show off and [posted a video to mastodon](https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/000/856/565/original/3b6206bfbcebc110.mp4), which finally got me followed by Eugen. So yeah, I'm big league now.

[^1]: One death every two years doesn't seem so bad until you consider that no more than 10,000 people walk the Laugavegur trail every year (by my estimate), probably fewer. 20,000:1 chance of death&mdash;still not bad odds. But I had no idea how much experience the typical walker had Laugavegur, perhaps I was less prepared than average and the odds for rubes like me were much worse?
[^2]: I decided that, in the event, I'd probably rather not actually die than risk dying of embarrassment at having to be rescued to be rescued by a big well-prepared Icelandic Real Man. Just.
[^3]: At this time I also realised that the gloves I'd brought with me had a hole in them. Luckily in the high tourist season there's a little shop open at the campsite selling coffess, hot drinks, and extortionitly priced hiking gear. Still afraid of being underequipped in any way, I spent 3500ISK (£25!) on the only gloves they had, these rather natty mittens. ![Mittens](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/mittens.jpg){:.center width="50%"} I am very attached to these mittens now. I nearly ran off a cliff chasing them when they blew away in the wind. I love them and I'll take on every waliking trip I go on forever.
[^4]: I learned this by trying to translate (with my phone) the poem *Fjöll* by [Jóhannes úr Kötlum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3hannes_%C3%BAr_K%C3%B6tlum), a framed print of which hung on the wall in the Þórsmörk FI hut.
[^5]: I don't know very much about photographic composition, but I think this might be the 'best' photograph I took on the hike. The colours are nice.

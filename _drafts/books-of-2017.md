#### *The Secret History* & *The Goldfinch*, Donna Tartt.
Tartt is an extraordinary writer I've come to a bit late. She's a master at writing the kinds of books you can live in. With *The Secret History* this is a straightforward evocation of a place and time&mdash;I've no doubt that had I read it aged 19 I would have been obsessed by it. In *The Goldfinch* it's less clear how the liveableness is acheived, but it's clearly there.

#### *Against Everything*, Mark Greif.  
Mark Greif's best essays from the last decade, which were mainly published in *n+1*, the highly influential literary magazine that he created. I'd never read any of his writing before. I regret that because it's really, *really* good. To have a whole book at once was a real treat. Looking back through my copy I've underlined something on almost every page. Some standouts for me were:

* **Octomom and the Market in Babies**

* **Learning to Rap.** Just a teaser for this:
> It's a fortunate fate to have your life be contemporary with the creation of a major art form. Embarrassing, then, not to have understood it, or appreciated, or become an enthusiast, even a fanatic, for the first. Especially shameful when it could have carried you, if only in imagination, across a racial barrier in America&mdash;at least as far as you can go without kidding yourself, when you're white, and therefore approaching from the wrong side.

* **Mogadishu, Baghdad, Troy, or Heroes Without War**


#### *Silas Marner*, George Eliot.

#### *Do No Harm*, Henry Marsh.
A memoir of sorts from Britain's most prominent neurosurgeon, telling stories of his successes and failures and how he copes.
I'd been putting off reading this for a while, despite several recommendations, because of my utter horror of severe mental disabilities and personality change that can result from brain surgery. I think this stuff scares me for the same reasons that talk of strong or superintelligent AI scares me: because it reveals personhood to be a nothing, a spook. What I am can be destroyed or utterly changed by a matter of millimetres.  
There is some of of that in this book, but actually it's much more about the surgeon than the patients: how you deal with the responsibility of a mind, a life in your hands, how you decide whether or not to take the risks, and how to live with yourself when it goes wrong. Henry Marsh is brilliantly human throughout.  
The actual descriptions of surgery are gripping, the human drama playing out while the gore is basically ignored in the way only a surgeon could ignore it. As I said before, for the most part it's the philosophical horror of brain surgery that upsets me rather than physical discomfort, but I did have to suppress a small gag at "open [the patient's] head". Marsh uses this phrase often and with obvious relish, as though he's cracking open a soft-boiled egg at the breakfast table.

#### The Blue Fox, Sj&oacute;n.  

#### Worst book: *The Fish Ladder*, Katherine Norbury

## Mackerel, potato, and radish salad

Makes two large dinner portions, or 4 lunch portions.

#### Ingredients

* ~300g smoked peppered mackerel fillets
* 500g baby new potatoes, halved
* 400g radishes, topped
* bag of peppery greens: rocket, baby spinach, cress, &c.
* 6 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp natural yoghurt
* juice of 1/2 a lemon
* 1 crushed garlic clove
* 1/2 pack of dill, chopped finely
* salt and pepper
* fancy bread to serve (I used rye bread)

#### Method

Heat the oven to 220C.
Put the potatoes and radishes in a roasting dish with 3 tbsp on the oil, seasoned with salt and pepper.
Put the dish in the oven for ~40 minutes, tossing halfway through.

To make the dressing, blend the remaining oil with the garlic, lemon juie, yoghurt, and dill. Stir again before serving.

Remove the veg from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes. Toss the salad with the dressing and add the vegetables. Shred the mackerel fillets and add them to the mix as well.
Serve with bread.

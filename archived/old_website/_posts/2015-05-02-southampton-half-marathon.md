Last weekend I ran in the first Southampton half marathon. I was pretty nervous
about it, because I got an injury in February and wasn't able to do as much
training as I would have liked. Also, I passed out about 300m before the finish
line of the previous half marathon I raced in.

But it went better than expected! I was slow to warm up, but once I'd been over
the Itchen bridge and back I was feeling relaxed and confident. I ended up
finishing in 1:34:56, which is a new record for me. I'm hoping to enter another
half soon and see if I can get below 1:30:00 with a bit more training.

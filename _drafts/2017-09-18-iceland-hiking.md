This June, after travelling to Reykjavík for work and [a little bit of tourism](/2017/07/09/reykjavik/), I spent the better part of a week hiking in Iceland's Southern highlands. I have some experience of mountain walking (solo and in small groups), but this was the first big trip I've done on my own. The short version is: it went really well, I had a great time. The trails I walked&mdash;Laugavegur, a day walk around Þórsmörk, and the Skógar trail over Fimmvörðuháls&mdash;are all absurdly scenic. If you're into hiking, and you have the time and resources, I really recommend taking this trip. In good weather the walks themselves are not very challenging and could be completed by anybody healthy and not too unfit.

That said, the weather is very variable in the interior of Iceland and the trails come with lots of warnings. I was lucky and had generally good weather, but it is important to take the advice of the wardens. In the weeks before my trip, when I started to think seriously about my kit and provisions, I made myself pretty anxious reading the very stern safety notices and the horror stories of calamities that have befallen other walkers on these paths. Somebody dies here every other year[^1] and many more are evacuated with hypothermia. The wind and rain can be pretty brutal, and on the high passes it can become very hard to navigate in the fog. Blizzard white-outs are not uncommon and people routinely get lost and caught out in the weather and have to be rescued.

Before I went I feared I had taken on too much. Perhaps I should have done a similar multi-day solo trip somewhere safer and less remote, or instead done this trip with a friend? But by this point I had spent a lot of money, I had told a lot of people I was going, and anyway, what was I, a man or a mouse? So I went down to the outdoors shop and spent more money than I could afford on equipment: new over-trousers, merino base layers for top and bottom, a thick scarf, bio-vac emergency bag, extensible walking pole for safely crossing rivers, and a hand-held GPS device. I also rented an emergency radio locator beacon in Reykjavík to take with me, so if the absolute worst happened and I got completely lost and started suffering from hypothermia, I could put all my clothes on, climb into my bio-vac bag, set off the beacon and wait to be rescued.[^2]

So, reassured at least that I wasn't going to die, I got up early one typical drizzly morning in Reykjavík, shouldered my bag full of equipment and food (mainly oats, pasta, and tinned fish), and walked down to the station to catch the bus to [Landmannalaugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmannalaugar).

### Landmannalaugar

The bus journey was not encouraging. The landscape got rapidly more forbidding and the weather deteriorated quickly. After an a couple of hours driving on the ring road towards  the South of the island we turned off of regular highways altogether and headed onto bumpy, jarring mountain roads. At one point the bus stopped to allow us out to stretch our legs and take in a glacial river. Everybody else seemed comfortable and excited; I was shivering and afraid. The river was the bright eerie blue of seriously cold meltwater. It looked like a grave.

From that stop it was another hour along decreasingly road-like roads to Landmannalaugar. I'd been regularly checking the Ferðafélag Íslands ([Icelandic Hiking Association](https://www.fi.is/en)) Facebook page in the preceding weeks, and I was glad to see that the snow covering Landmannalaugar had finally melted. Everything was soggy, but at least pretty green:

![Landmannalaugar](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

The first trail I was going to walk was the [Laugavegur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugavegur), which runs 55 very varied km from Landmannalaugar to Þórsmörk. Since we were due to arrive in Landmannalaugar at 1pm, my plan had been to do just a short section of the trail on the first afternoon, 4.5 hours uphill to the FI Hut at the pass at Hrafntinnusker. By the time we arrived though it was clear that it wasn't a good day for walking. The rain was like bullets and my coat was no match, I was extremely cold and damp within a few minutes of being outside. I went to the information hut and they told me that the weather reports from Hrafntinnusker (another 500m higher up and still covered in snow) were sufficiently worrying that the wardens were "strongly advising" walkers to stay the night at Landmannalaugar. So I dropped off my bag in the dorm room in the hut and settled in for the afternoon.[^3]

Besides being the start point of the Laugavegur (and numerous other walks in the area), Landmannalaugar is famous for its hot springs&mdash;"Landmannalaugar" loosely translates as "The Common Man's Pools". I had planned to just take a look at the pools before starting out, but since I was delayed for the day I was able to take a dip. That meant walking the 100m to the springs outside in the driving rain in my trunks, but I fugured the water would make up for it. Most people I suppose, when they think of hot springs in Iceland, think of the [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com/) or similar; the pools at Landmannalaugar are a little less fancy:
![Landmannalaugar hot springs](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar-springs.jpg){:.center width="90%"}
I later found out that the nice even temperature you get at the Blue Lagoon is not an accident: the whole thing was purpose-built as a tourist attraction. It turns out real hot springs aren't lovely bathwater rising from the ground. Instead there is a freezing cold river and a few springs of literally boiling water spewing out from underground into it. One sits on the gravelly riverbed and tries to find a position where the hot and cold mix to a bearable medium, getting periodically burned or too cold as the wind and currents change. Which isn't to say I didn't like it, but it wasn't the luxury experience I had anticipated. I stayed in for about an hour though, huddled around the springs like penguins with the other bathers, trying to ignore the rain in our eyes. It was an experience anyway. When I got out I realised somebody had mistakenly taken my towel and I had to make my way back shivering violently in the rain. It seems a bit ridiculous to say now, but at the time I felt like I understood, physically for the first time, how easy it would be to die of cold.

I whiled away most of the rest of the day reading a book on my eReader (*Silas Marner* &ndash; George Eliot) and exchanging nervous pleasantries with other hikers. Some were clearly old hands, but others seemed no more serious about it than me. A large guided tour group of twenty or so (mostly) Americans were in high spirits, presumably because they were paying not to have to worry (or cook their own meals; I felt very uncharitable to these people all week). As far as I could tell, there was only one other solo hiker staying in the hut, a Canadian woman called Amy. She told me she had also been forced to delay her start, but wasn't planning to do a double stage the next day. Most of the others were small groups of 2,3 or 4 people who seemed about as prepared as me, but less nervous (perhaps from experience). This was only my impression of the people in the huts though; the people camping outside seemed like a much hardier folk. I admired them, but I was extremely pleased to have chosen to fork out the £50 a night for the huts rather than camp in this place. The accommodation in the hut was pretty basic&mdash;your £50 buys a mattress in a dorm room for 20 and access to a shared kitchen and bathroom&mdash;but the campsite was a world away from my experience:
![Landmannalaugar campsite](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar-campsite.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

After dinner I shared tea and talked with two Germans, Anna from Freiburg and her friend Laura from Berlin. They were good Leftists (Anna is doing her PhD on critiques of capitalism) and we had a rare non-frustrating conversation about Brexit and the EU. We got on well and I was sorry not to be walking with them&mdash;they were planning to set out on the Laugavegur the next day as well, but would only go so far as Hraftinnusker and so would be a day behind me for the rest.

When the rain finally stopped at around 10pm, Anna and Laura went for a late evening walk (there being plenty of light at this time of year, no real night in fact, just twilight). I settled into bed, read a bit more of *Silas Marner*, and went to sleep early.


### Day 1: Landmannalaugar &ndash; Álftavatn

The first section of the Laugavegur goes 12km along and 530 metres up from Landmannalaugar to the FI hut at the Hraftinnusker pass: not a huge altitude change for that horizontal distance. The height is gained through a pleasant mix of gentle slopes and short steep climbs, which makes for a pretty invigorating morning's walk.

After breakfast (porridge made with dehydrated milk; passable), and some time spent anxiously re-checking my equipment, I set off shortly before 8am. After layering up against the cold and damp, the exercise made me almost immediately too warm and I had to keep stopping to remove layers. The first couple of km of the walk go through a field of lava boulders surrounded by multicoloured rhyolite hills. To start with I couldn't walk more than a hundred metres without stopping to take a picture. I'd expected to take a lot of photos, but I realised pretty soon that I'd have to start rationing them out if I wanted to get anywhere. An American couple, James & Julie, had started out at the same time as me and their progress was similarly halting as they stopped for pictures and to adjust their layers. We passed each other back and forth all through the boulder field, until we reached the first steep hill and I left them behind. I'm good at hills.

That first steep climb was accompanied by a persistent sulfur smell. I could see gases venting from the flanks of the hills on either side and I was catching the smell diluted by the wind. Although there were blocks of unmelted ice scattered around the path, there were also patches of ground that were hot to the touch. It was like Winter in Mordor. Near the top of the climb I caught up a family with two children who couldn't have been older than 12. I realised that I wasn't nervous any more and was beginning to enjoy myself. The exercise had loosened my body and released some anxiety; the presense of literal children on the walk removed a lot of the feeling of danger.[^4] I gave them a cheerfully mispronounced *Góðan daginn* as I passed and sped on to the top of the hill.

![Snowy hills](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day1-snowy-hills.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

From there the Laugavegur follows a sweeping curve overlooking a valley with more hotspots and pools of bright acidic-green water (more hints of sulfur on the air). The hills around started getting properly snowy, and path crossed its first patch of unmelted packed ice.
Then another steep climb, and when it levelled off again the path was more under ice than not. Forced to slow down a bit, I noticed I was starting to get chilly, more from the wind coming across the open snowfield than the air temperature. I put on my hat and new mittens and trudged on. After a couple of kilometres the path gets up close to a hotspot for the first time. I'd seen the steam pouring from the ground at a distance, but it was another thing to get up close and [stand in the middle](https://goo.gl/MdL4fq) of an eggy cloud, with boiling water erupting right under my boots. My favourite thing of all was the way that the heat seemed to carve the snow, leaving unnatural-looking vertical faces as if a giant had been along with a butter knife.

![Hotspot](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day1-hotspot.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

After the hotspot the path dips down into a small valley where a signpost indicates an alternative path back to Landmannalaugar. The path then climbs steeply one more time before settling out into a broad rise covered in fresh snow; apparently there had been a blizzard the night before. The walking here was pretty hard going and the wind was biting. I put my coat on and got out my new walking pole for the first time. I stumbled about in the powder a lot, but the pole caught me and I made my way slowly forwards. Navigationally this was very easy, I just had to follow the waymarkers and footprints into the right pass. But I was beginning to appreciate how hard it would be if snow or fog kept you from seeing the next pole. At a distance all the passes looked the same to me, and I wouldn't be confident of finding the right one.

The view on the approach to FI hut at Hraftinnusker (*En.:* "obsidian skerry") through the pass is very romantic. A tiny hut sits in the snow, tucked away under the crest of the hill to shelter it from the wind. A nearby hotspot supplies warm water. The last slope down to the hut is shingled with shards of obsidian. I was very pleased not to have been up here in the blizzard, but I was a bit disappointed at missing out on a night up in the snow and not to have a chance to go to the ice caves nearby.

![Hraftinnusker](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/hraftinnusker.jpg "FI hut at Hraftinnusker"){:.center width="90%"}

I arrived at the hut just before 11am, closely followed by James and Julie, who had caught up on the snow thanks to the micro spikes they'd attached to their boots. It had taken me 3 hours to walk here from Landmannalaugar, contrary to my guidebook's estimate of 4.5 hours (see? Good at hills). Since we weren't guests at the hut we only had access to the porch area. Sitting still I started to notice the cold, so I crammed down some lunch (malt loaf, raisins and nuts) and forged on towards Álftavatn, another 12km away.

After a couple more kilometres across the snowfields, the path crosses a series of gullies. Apparently this section is harder work in the high season once all the snow has melted; I was able to skip a couple of gullies by walking over ice bridges. This bit of the walk was the most work, physically. It was a lot of fun, especially the last gully which was full of sticky volcanic mud and more unnatural smells. Dipping into each empty valley, with nobody else in sight, it was easy to believe that I was utterly alone in the world.[^5]

Eventually the gullies and the snow came to an end at Jökultungur and the view ahead opened up all way to the lake Álftavatn in the distance, the next stop. This part of the walk is a very long downhill, about 600m, and quite tough on my knees. On the descent I was overtaken by a group of people *running* down the hill, who I assumed must be training for the [Laugavegur ultramarathon](http://www.marathon.is/ultramarathon).

![Álftavatn valley view](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day1-valley-view.jpg){:.center width="90%"}


Finally the path flattened out, but there was one more trial for the day: the first proper river crossing. The guidebooks had told me that there is no avoiding getting you feet wet a few times on the Laugavegur. The reccommended river crossing method is to switch your boots for a pair of quick-drying shoes, roll up your trousers and go slowly across using your pole for stability (you don't want to fall over in the river because that's a really good shortcut to hypothermia). the reccommended method is exactly what I did, except the bit about going slowly because the water is unbelievably cold. Physical pain in the feet is instant and bone deep. Luckily this first river was a narrow one and it was over in about 10 seconds, but it made me wary for the crossings to come.

From the river it was just a couple more easy kilometres down to the hut at Áltavatn. I got there shortly after, buffeted by gusting winds coming through the valley. Once I'd found the warden and be let inside I went straight to sleep for a couple of hours, having not slept very well the night before. When I woke up there were three military-grade German men sharing my room, all roughly the size and shape of Daniel Craig (and one who had the same face). They told me that they'd stayed the night at Hraftinnusker and had been lost in the blizzard for two hours, all looking a bit harrowed when they spoke about it. Still, they seemed quite impressed that I was on my own and that I'd walked from Landmannalaugar in 7.5 hours.

In the kitchen I met a new batch of people, including another English man, Steve, who shared his teabags with me. The Canadian lady Amy was there as well, she'd changed her mind and done the double stage after all. Much later the tour group of Americans arrived, their bags having been brought by jeep and a giant pot of goat stew waiting for them. I was jealous of the stew, but  was also wallowing in a slightly shameful feeling of superiority at doing everything for myself.

In the evening the wind died down and sun came out. I took a stroll down to the water's edge to take some pictures before heading back inside for a hot chocolate and bed.

### Day 2: Álftavatn &ndash; Emstrur


The next morning the sun was still shining. My guidebook estimated 6 hours for the 16km walk to Emstrur, but having realised I was faster than the book I didn't hurry over breakfast. I hung around long enough to eat the tour group's leftover breakfast. They had porridge as well, but theirs was fancy porridge and spiced with cinammon and apples. the porridge softened my feelings about the group&mdash;I'd been woken up by one of them whooping at the breakfast table but accepted the leftovers as an apology they didn't know they were giving.

It's always easier to get going if there's just one of you though, and I was still one of the first people to set off.
![Áltavatn morning](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/alftavatn-morning.jpg){:.center width="90%"}
The second day's walk on the Laugavegur was much flatter but came with two proper river crossings. The first, Brattháls, is just a km along the path from Áltavatn. It was much wider than the river I had crossed the previous day, but it was only shin deep and had quite a flat riverbed so I was able to cross quite quickly. Still very very cold though and I hopped about a bit on the other side to get some life back into my feet. After I put my boots back on I stopped to watch a young Spansih couple cross. It looked to me like they were making quite a meal of it, but I imagine I didn't look very graceful crossing either.

For the next hour the path stayed on grassy, peaty ground, making for plesaant unchallenging walking. Past the campsite at Hvanngill there is a much more serious river that has to be crossed at a footbridge. I took a short detour downstream to see a large waterfall reccommended by the guidebook. Back on the path the river Bláfjallakvísl has to be forded. Several small groups of people had cuaght me up while I was looking at the waterfall and they were pacing up and down the banks looking for a good place to cross. Nowhere seemed much better than anywehere else to me, so I took off my boots and zipped off my trousers and got on with it again. It was knee-deep and wide and the uneven river bed forced me to go slowly. Perhaps I was getting used to the shock of the cold, or perhaps the others watching me enforced a stiff upper lip, but I crossed quite calmly despite my shin bones feeling like they might fracture as they froze.

From Bláfjallakvísl until the end of the day's walk at Emstrur they path is a dusty trail across an ashy desert between strange single cone-mountains, which look like they have just be placed alone in the dust in some kind of environment builder. I stopped for lunch at footbridge by another waterfall and climbed on some boulders for a bit, showing off to nobody around. I took another detour over a small fell which the path contours around. On the other side I caught up to another American couple just in time for them to photo me at the best posing spot on the trail, a lava outcrop with the North side of [Hattafell](https://goo.gl/P5sQbf) in the backround.

![Posing](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day2-pose.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

The day's walk ends by descending to the FI huts in the Botnar valley at Emstrur. On the approach one can see the vast Mýrdalsjökull glacier taking up the horizon, and its tongue Entujökull snaking down into the valley on the other side.
![Botnar](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/botnar.jpg){:.center width="90%"}
I got to the huts at about 2:30 and pottered away the afternoon reading my book and talking about the day's walk to people as trickled in. After two days walking I was starting to smell, so I bit the bullet and paid the 500kr (£3.75) for a shower.[^6]
I realised that I'd managed to get sunburned. (who takes sun lotion to Iceland? Not me.)

After dinner I went for a walk with Amy to see the nearby Markafljótsgljúfur canyon. I'd never seen a proper canyon before, something about all that empty space was mesmerising. We got right up to the edge for some pictures and peered over some [sickening drops](https://goo.gl/8xVVfU).
![Sunburn](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day2-sunburn.jpg){:.center width="90%"}
Below us in the canyon some white specks swooped through air: [Fulmars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulmar) (*Ís.: Fýll*) that nest in the cliffs. I spent a long time trying to get a good picture of one in flight but [never](https://goo.gl/VpCYZn) [really](https://goo.gl/6TaEJq) [managed](https://goo.gl/S4936T) [it](https://goo.gl/gcwsMo). I realised on this trip that I'm really into birds? It came as a bit of a shock to be honest. For some reason the [map](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Island-Serkort-04-Landmannalaugar-Porsm%C3%B6rk/dp/997933035X/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505734438&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=serikort+4) I brought had pictures of all the birds you are likely to see in the area: an unusual feature, but a source of much interest among the walkers as we sat around the table in our hut that night.[^7]

### Day 3: Emstrur &ndash; Þórsmörk

The final day of the Laugavegur is a long shallow descet to the forested river valley of Þórsmörk. While the individual views are perhaps less striking than on the previous days, it's interesting to see the landcsape slowly change kilometre by kilometre as the dust gives way to vegetation, first grassland and then shrubs and finally actual trees (quite rare in Iceland). The guidebook said it was only 15km to Þórsmörk, so like the day before I didn't leave in any hurry. The previous evening had been quite sociable in the hut and we all lingered discussing our plans over breakfast for quite a while before setting out. I think I probably could have joined up with some of them and walked in a small group, but for some reason it didn't appeal. I liked talking to these people in the evenings, but I was now confident walking alone and wanted a chance to enjoy the solitude.

The walking on this day was mostly uneventful. Early on I managed to avoid getting my feet wet again by throwing my bag across a narrow river and doing a running jump. I slipped and fell over on the landing, but at least nobody was around to see it. Much later in the day there was a very narrow gorge with a waterfall in it that I was convinced I could jump. But, instead of just getting wet feet, messing it up would have meant a 10m fall into a surging river and probably death. that seemed like a stupid way to die, even for me, so I took the bridge downstream.
![River gorge](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day3-river.jpg "I'm not quite stupid enough to try the jump"){:.center width="40%"}

At lunchtime, sitting on a sandy bank by the side of some reddish grassland, I heard strange bridcalls, first one, then another. Turning, I saw an unfamiliar bird dart across the sky, chased by another of the same species. Mating, or some kid of play? I'm not sure. The pair disappeared behind a hill, but I could still hear their cries so I sat patiently waiting for their return. I spent a while trying to get close enough to get a clear photograph,&mdash;me quietly advancing, the bird swiftly retreating,&mdash;still with no real success. I settled for a picture at a distance as it flew off again. Some work with the bird bit of my map and YouTube videos of bird calls when I got home identified it as a [Whimbrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whimbrel) (*Ís: Spói*).
![Bird](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day3-bird.jpg "whimbrel?"){:.center width="90%"}

A few km before the Laugavegur ends there is one more river to cross, the Þröngá, which is narrow and fast-flowing. The water came up to my lower thighs at an unexpected deep patch but by now I was starting to enjoy the performance of the crossings. As I arrived at the river I met a pair of French hikers who had just crossed from the other direction. They were pleased to hear there were no more river crossings for them to so that day. A group of 5 men arrived on the opposite bank just as I'd finished switching shoes watched me cross and asked how cold it was; they were just starting out hiking the Laugavegur in the opposite direction. I told them to get it over with quickly.

The Þröngá marks the boundary of the [Þórsmörk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%B3rsm%C3%B6rk) valley,[^8] a popular hiking area. From the river it is only a short walk to the end of the trail, either at Langidalur or Húsadalur. At the fork in the path I went left to Langidalur and finished the Laugavegur at the FI hut in a pretty, grassy spot on the shingle banks of the Krossá.

![Þórsmörk hut](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/thorsmork-hut.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

Since Þórsmörk is served by a (off-road capable) bus from Reykjavík, the FI hut is a lot larger and better-equipped than the others on the Laugavegur. The dorm rooms in the hut were all under wooden sloping roofs, which gave everything a pleasant alpine feel.

After I'd dropped my bag I spent the rest of the afternoon on a small circular walk to the more upmarket Volcano Huts site at Húsadalur, which was rumoured to have beer and hot baths and sauna. Along the way I passed an overhanging cliff with a cave, which bears the inscriptions of centuries of visitors to the area, including "Gvðmvðvz Einázsson 1773". Curiously enough, when I talked to a group of Americans about this cliff face later, they all thought the inscriptions were fake. I not sure why they were all so certain of this, it looked authentic to me. Is it because America is such a young country that anything purporting to be from 1773 is far more likely to be fake than not? It reminded me of Bill Bryson's remark in *Notes from a Small Island* that there were more 17th century buildings in his Yorkshire village than in the whole of North America.

There was indeed a bar at the volcano huts. The pint I bought cost £10 and wasn't anything special, but I really enjoyed it all the same (not enough to pay another tenner for a second though). I spotted Steve, an English guy who'd emigrated to Iceland, who I'd shared a hut with for the last couple of nights. I sat and chatted with him for a bit about how to do move to Iceland (step 1: have your own software business that allows you to work easily remotely, :( ), then bought a ticket for the hot bath and sauna.
The hot bath turned out to be what looked like a concrete fish pond full of tepid water, so I skipped it and went straight for the sauna, a strange converted barrel where I endured half an hour or so of 70&deg;C before I escaped back out into the (now-refreshing) wind.

The walk back to the FI hut took me over the small peak Valahnukur, which offers spectacular views all over the Krossá river valley and the flodplains of the Markarfljót.

On the way back down Langidalur I followed a [Redwing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwing) (*Ís: SkógarÞröstur*) that had bobbed out onto the path in front, trying to get a good picture (still no luck). Back at the hut most of the regular faces from the previous nights had arrived as well by now. After I cooked my last pasta + tinned fish and pesto dinner (green pesto & sardines, not bad; green pesto & tuna was probably the best combination) I sat and shared a pot of peppermint tea with these friends and talked for a couple of hours until I took myself off to bed.

### Day 4: Daywalk around Þórsmörk, including Rjúpnafell

In the morning I spent a while saying goodbyes. Most of the other hikers I'd got to know over the last few days on the Laugavegur were either heading back to Reykjavík or setting out to do the route to Skógar over two days, staying overnight at the hut at Fimmvörðuháls. It had originally been my plan as well to do that  as well, but in the weeks leading up to the trip I'd gotten nervous (the Fimmvörðuháls pass being permenantly snow-covered and most susceptible to extreme weather) and cancelled the hut, swapping it for another night in Þórsmörk. Now, more confident in my ability and less worried about the snow, I'd decided I'd like to do the Skógar route after all. The hut at the pass was fully booked for the night though, so I'd have to do it all in one go. I decided to go for a day walk in the Þórsmörk area and wait and see what the weather forecast for the next day said. If it was good I'd get up early and go for it.

So with the possibility of a long walk the next day I set out for a short walk I'd planned to last three hours or so. Since I was staying in the same hut that night I didn't have to take my bag with me, and it was a relief for my shoulders to be enencumbered for the day. I set off along the valley, following the Krossá upstream for half an hour or so before turning off onto an uphill path through a birch wood, eventually coming out on a windy plain. I took a small diversion to the top of a cliff to get a good view of the river valley

After coming down from the cliff and walking along the plain for a while I realised I didn't know where I was. I wouldn't say that I was lost, since I could easily have retraced my path back to the hut, but the way the path went ahead of me didn't map to the path I had memorised at breakfast from a map of local walking routes. Somewhere in the woods I must have taken a wrong turn. The Laugavegur had been so well marked that I'd grown complacent about needing a map, and I hadn't brought one with me on this walk (since I wasn't taking a bag and didn't want to carry it in my hand). I carried on along the path I was on anyway and eventually came out in sight of of a beautiful mountain in the distance, which I later learned is called Rjúpnafell: literally, in English, '[Ptarmigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_ptarmigan)[^9] mountain[^10]'. Even from this distance I could see an attractive zig-zag path leading to the top. Even though it was in completely the wrong direction to return to the hut, I thought I'd better go for it.

I had to cross a valley with some interesting caves to get to the foot of the mountain. The zig-zag path quickly grew pretty steep, but it meant the ascent didn't take too long. After the zig zgas there was an even steeper climb with quite a lot of exposure, but that was mercifully brief and then I was at the first, slightly lower summit. From there I followed a path over a narrow col to the summit proper. When I got there I was surprised when to discover I had 3G on my phone, so I seized the opportunity to show off and [posted a video to mastodon](https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/000/856/565/original/3b6206bfbcebc110.mp4). It got a very gratifying number of boosts and faves, and finally got me followed by Eugen. So yeah, I'm big league now.

I tried to come down the mountain a different way than the way I went up, but soon realised I was walking slowly towards a cliff with no easy path down, so I backtracked to the summit and went down the zig-zag path. At the bottom I headed back to the spot where I'd decided to climb the mountain from, a crossing point of a few different paths. I still didn't really understand where I was, but I chose the only path that I thoguht went roughly in the direction of the hut that wasn't also the path I had come up on.

Luckily it turned out to go the right way, and by a very nice route past lots of interesting rock formations. The best was Trollakirkja (*En: troll's church*), which had a very inviting rock chute up the side that I was pretty sure I could climb. I only got a third of the way up though before I thought better of it, reasoning that since I hadn't seen a single person for the last five hours, this would be a really bad place to fall and break my leg. By coincidence I'd highlighted a line in *Silas Marner* the night before that may have made me more wary of angering any local trolls:
> The gods of the hearth exist for us still; and let all new faith be tolerant of that fetishism, lest it bruise its own roots.

After the troll's church it was a pleasant but uneventful hour's walk back to Langidalur. When I got to the hut I found that Anna & Laura had arrived, and I spent a while talking to them about their hike while they ate their dinner. I'd run out of my own food that day and had planned to buy more at the little shop, but I was saved from the high prices by other people's leftovers. The American couple James & Julie had given me some of their special hiking food packs, and I managed to cobble together a meal from that and the little bits that people had left in the communal area of the kitchen. Freeze-dried chicken mixed through basmati with mustard never tasted so good.

After dinner I checked the forecast for the next day with the hut staff. They told me the pass would cloudy but otherwise fine and gave me the ok gesture, so I decided to go ahead early in the morining. I spent the rest of the evening settled into the sofas in the communal room finishing off *Silas Marner*. I was joined by a pair of couples, fifyish I think, who were having a holiday together. One couple was Finnish and the other Icelandic. They were very nice and very inquisitive (especially the Finnish woman), they gave me a beer and some blueberry chocolate and asked me all about my life. the Icelandic woman, Thorslaug, told me how she'd been in this area when the volcano erupted in 2010 and how they'd all had to stay in the hut for a week. They got steadily drunker and more merry, and eventually went outside "to meet the Cuban delegation", which it turns out meant to smoke huge cigars and drink whicky from the bottle. On reflection I'm not convinced they weren't swingers.

<div style="font-size: 80%">
[^1]: One death every two years doesn't seem so bad until you consider that no more than 10,000 people walk the Laugavegur trail every year (by my estimate), probably fewer. 20,000:1 chance of death&mdash;still not bad odds. But I had no idea how much experience the typical walker had Laugavegur, perhaps I was less prepared than average and the odds for rubes like me were much worse?
[^2]: I decided that, in the event, I'd probably rather not actually die than risk dying of embarrassment at having to be rescued by a big well-prepared Icelandic Real Man. Just.
[^3]: At this time I also realised that the gloves I'd brought with me had a hole in them. Luckily in the high tourist season there's a little shop open at the campsite selling coffess, hot drinks, and extortionitly priced hiking gear. Still afraid of being underequipped in any way, I spent 3500ISK (£25!) on the only gloves they had, these rather natty mittens. ![Mittens](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/mittens.jpg){:.center width="50%"} I am very attached to these mittens now. I nearly ran off a cliff chasing them when they blew away in the wind. I love them and I'll take on every waliking trip I go on forever.
[^4]: These turned out to be the only children I saw all week though; perhaps their parents were just very confident (or irresponsible?)
[^5]: I was alone for most of the time on the trail, but not really *that* alone; I'd guess that I was never more than half an hour's walk from another group.
[^6]: Technically the 500kr buys 5 minutes of hot (eggy) water; if you want, you can have a cold shower for free. The cold water is *really* cold though, the same as in the rivers. The effect of putting your head under is the same as biting ice cream.
[^7]: I never actually used this map or my compass for navigation; I definitely didn't need to use the magnetic declination chart or the GPS device. In good weather the path is very clear at all times.
[^8]: Pronounced "Thors-murk" (roughly), by the way. That "Þ" is a [thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter)), not a p.
[^9]: I didn't manage to spot a ptarmigan (pretty dissappointed about that) , but I did see a falcon on the approach to the base of the mountain. The FI staff told me it was very probably a [Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(bird)) (*Ís.: Smyrill*), although it might also have been a [Gyrfalcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrfalcon) (*Ís.: Fálki*).
[^10]: Just like in English, Icelandic uses *fell* to mean a small mountain. The Icelandic word for proper-sized mountains is *Fjall* (or *Fjöll* in the plural). I learned this trying to translate the poem *Fjöll* by [Jóhannes úr Kötlum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3hannes_%C3%BAr_K%C3%B6tlum) with my phone. A framed print of it hung on the wall in the Þórsmörk FI hut.
[^11]: I don't know very much about photographic composition, but I think this might be the 'best' photograph I took on the hike. The colours are nice.

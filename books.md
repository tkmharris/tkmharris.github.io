### 2017


1. **Neoreaction a Basilisk**, Phil Sandifer.  

2. **I Hate the Internet**, Jarett Kobek.  
276 pages of caustic rage directed at rich technologists.

3. **Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic**, Anita & Solomon Feferman.  

4. **A Winter Book**, Tove Jansson. &dagger; (Swedish)

5. **The Fish Ladder**, Katharine Norbury.  
A potentially-interesting nature book ruined by the author's unbearable narcissism.

6. **Orkneyinga Saga**, Anonymous. &dagger; (Old Norse)  
The saga of the Earls of Orkney from 950ish to 1200ish. Part history, part legend, [frequently unintentionally hilarious](/2017/03/02/orkneyinga-saga/).

7. **Fingersmith**, Sarah Waters.  

8. **The Secret History**, Donna Tartt.  

9. **Beyond the Northlands**, Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough.  

10. **A Tale for the Time Being**, Ruth Ozeki.  
I heard about this on the [Overdue podcast](http://overduepodcast.com/) so I knew some of the story in advance. A meditation of sorts on time and suffering, but wrapped up in a flowing story. Its comparisons between Zen Buddhism and quantum physics irked me no end (as always). Otherwise very good.

11. **Zero K**, Don Delillo.  

12. **Wild**, Cheryl Strayed.  

13. **The Housekeeper and the Professor**, Yoko Ogawa. &dagger; (Japanese)  
Novella about a mathematician with an 80 minute memory, his housekeeper, and her son. Includes some simple, but correct, maths and is mostly non-embarrassing for the mathematically-trained to read.

14. **Concepts of Modern Mathematics**, Ian Stewart.  
The maths book I wish somebody had given me when I was 18. Explains the ideas behind various parts of modern maths in a non-technical but also not-empty manner.

15. **June**, Gerbrand Bakker. &dagger; (Dutch)  

16. **Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency**, Douglas Adams.  

17. **The Descent of Man**, Grayson Perry.  
Short collection of Perry's thoughts on masculinity and how it needs to be updated. Not a deep analysis, but a good introduction for the curious.

18. **Silas Marner**, George Eliot.  

19. **Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit**, Jeanette Winterson.  

20. **Against Everything**, Mark Greif.  
I got this book of essays I went to see Mark Greif interviewed by Laurie Penny at the *LRB* bookshop at the end of last year. I must have underlined at least one sentence per page, Greif is a hell of a writer.

21. **Kill All Normies**, Angela Nagle.  

22. **The Blue Fox**, Sj&oacute;n. &dagger; (Icelandic)

23. **Do No Harm**, Henry Marsh.

24. **Heroes of the Frontier**, Dave Eggers.  

25. **In Watermelon Sugar**, Richard Brautigan.

Wittgenstein lived a beautiful life.

9. **A303: the Highway to the Sun**, Tom Fort.  

10. **We Have Always Lived in the Castle**, Shirley Jackson.  
I wonder why so much gothic horror is set in New England?
*(edit: one-word answer suggested by Emilio Pierro -- "Puritans")*

11. **Siddhartha**, Hermann Hesse. &dagger; (German)  

12. **The Outrun**, Amy Liptrot.

23. **The Shpeherd's Life**, James Rebanks.  

24. **An Account of the Decline of the Great Auk, According to One Who Saw It**, Jessie Greengrass.

### 2015

1. **Ayoade on Ayoade: a cinematic odyssey**, Richard Ayoade.  
Very, very funny. Did you know Werner Herzog is too self-conscious to eat Wiener
Hotdogs?

2. **My Struggle 1: a death in the family**, Karl Ove Knausg&#229;rd. &dagger; (Norwegian)  
The first volume of Knausg&#229;rd's autobiographical cycle.
It's brutally honest and incredibly good.

3. **Good Omens**, Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.  

4. **A View from the Foothills: the diaries of Chris Mullin 1999-2005**.  

5. **The Buried Giant**, Kazuo Ishiguro.

7. **So You've Been Publicly Shamed**, Jon Ronson.  

8. **Landmarks**, Robert Macfarlane.  
A celebration of MacFarlane's favourite nature writers.
Enjoyable, but not of the same standard as MacFarlane's The Old Ways*.

9. **The Cyberiad**, Stanis&#x142;aw Lem. &dagger; (Polish)  
Excelelnt translation.

13. **Foundation and Empire**, Isaac Asimov.
14. **Second Foundation**, Isaac Asimov.  

15. **This Changes Everything**, Naomi Klein.  
A rigorous discussion of the problem of climate change in a
liberal capitalist world. Frankly this made me pretty despondent for the future.

16. **Cakes, Custard, and Category Theory,** Eugenia Cheng.  
I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this very much,
I found it hard to distinguish from other pop-maths books.

17. **My Struggle 2: a man in love**, Karl Ove Knausg&#229;rd. &dagger; (Norwegian)  
Even better than the first volume.

18. **North**, Seamus Heaney.  

19. **Alan Turing: the Enigma**, Andrew Hodges.  
The gold standard for a scientific biography. Rather technical in places.

20. **The Innocence of Father Brown**, G. K. Chesterton.  

21. **A Room with a View**, E. M. Forster. &lowast;  
A re-read of an old favourite.

29. **The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest**, Stieg Larsson. &dagger; (Swedish)  
I didn't read these during the hype period of about a decade ago.
Suffice to say they were as gripping as expected.

31. **The Road to Little Dribbling**, Bill Bryson.

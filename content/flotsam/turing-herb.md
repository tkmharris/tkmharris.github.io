From an amazon.com [review](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3785IO9T49LAZ/) of Lewis & Papadimitrious's *Elements of the Theory of Computation*:
> And also... who the hell is this geek on the cover? It doesn't reveal his identity anywhere in the book. You know this book is bad when they have a herb like him staring at you. This guy needs a new suit, a haircut, and he needs to learn how to smile.

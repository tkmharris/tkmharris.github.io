## Glasgow
Here for BCC. Directly after Iceland, very tired. Lots of working class art; didn't go. Up, breakfast, conference, drop bag at hotel, dinner, brewdog with book, walk back drunk accross glasgow listening to local lads Mogwai's Kids Will Be Skeleton's getting those postrock Emotions. Sleep. Repeat x3.

## Montreal
Feel bad for not writing more because I've wanted to go since I was a teen obsessed with Arcade Fire (please don't judge; I'm moved on from Guardian rock to Guardian postrock now)
Didn't like it. Isn't it European? no. Did a fair amount of running, saw a raccoon. Didn't get to go to the funfair. old town nice, got a good London Fog. Tim Hortons great.
footnote: Title "I can't believe I'm going to write a mini-essay about coffee" A shame that the coffee culture the UK has inherited from North America is the premium mediocre starbucks model instead of the at least authentically cheap Tims/Dunkin donuts model. of course it sucks more that we've inherited the north american model at all. Australians are helping the UK switch to a less pint-of-coffee culture, but it's coming in as a luxury consumer thing. I read an article about starbucks opening their first italian branch the other day, and I though, you idots! you've already got it right. (other places with good coffee)

## Birmingham
Alright. Birmingham was a watchword for shit when I was young (No idea why, except: I grew up in a rural part of the countryside and Birmingham is culturally diverse. Make of that what you will.) Always surprised by how much I like it there, how down to eartn and friendly the people are.
Drank an awful lot. Featured in the 'Daily group theorist'

## Vienna
Here in v different circumstances. Am I different? Certainly, but also no? I would have laughed to imagine myself using the hotel gym & sauna (even if for me this was a bit perfomative, not what I usually do), then having a risotto & a nice glass of Riesling. But I didn't feel any different while I did it.

Swimming in the Danube: good. Sunburn: bad, but unavoidable unless you submit to spoiling the whole day with sun anxiety.

Met Tom from Masto. They were very nice and didn't murder me, so my mum was wrong about meeting people from the internet after all.

Hello, Robot ehibition at MAK: v good, very much my aesthetic. I think maybe I'm more into applied art than pure art now?

I've said before that I like being alone more than most people, but this has been too much travelling alone for me. I went to the prater, which should not be a solo trip. While I quite like eating alone, especially in Europe taking a book and eating at the bar, and I enjoy going to the cinema alone more now than I like going with others. Going on rollercoasters alone is a bridge too far though.

### 2 ingredient banana oat biscuits

This is a good way to use up old bananas that have gone a bit soft.
(Another good thing to do with those is to chop them up, freeze them, and use them in smoothies later.)

#### Ingredients

* 2 soft bananas
* 2 cups porridge oats
* Optional add-ins, e.g.:
  - chopped walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts
  - dried cranberries, or raisins
  - (dark) chocolate chips
  - mixed seeds


#### Method

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees C.

Mash the bananas until smooth and blend together with the oats
(for a smoother biscuit, blend the oats into a flour first). Sprinkle
the optional add-ins throughout the mixture.

Grease a baking tray. Make small balls out of the mixture and press
them into biscuit shapes about ~1.5cm thick on the tray. Bake for ~10
minutes or until the biscuits are set. Cool on a wire rack.


### Carrot, squash, and ginger soup

Makes two large portions.

#### Ingredients

* 1 onion, chopped.
* 3 large carrots, peeled and chopped into small chunks.
* ~400g butternut squash/pumpkin, peeled and chopped into small chunks.
* ~1 litre veg stock.
* Small chunk (~30g) of stem ginger, grated.
* ¼ tsp chili flakes.
* Salt and pepper to taste.
* Chopped fresh coriander leaves.

#### Method

Put the vegetables, ginger, and chili flakes in a saucepan.
Pour in the veg stock, stir it all through, and bring to the boil.
Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for ~25mins until the squash and
carrot are tender.

Blend until smooth, adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
Serve with the chopped coriander leaves scattered over,
with bread rolls on the side.

### Cheesy tomato risotto

Makes 2 dinner portions

#### Ingredients

* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped and crushed
* ~150g mushrooms, chopped
* 1 pepper, chopped (I usually use half a red one and half a yellow one)
* 200g risotto rice
* 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* ~100g grated cheese (more if desired)
* butter/oil
* 500ml veg stock
* salt/pepper/basil to season

#### Method

Melt the butter/ heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the chopped onion and garlic until soft. Add the mushrooms and continue to fry until they are browned. Add the peppers when the mushrooms are close to being done.

When all the veg is reasonably fried, add the dry risotto rice to the and stir it around to mix the veg through. Then add the veg stock and chopped tomatoes. Add salt/pepper/basil to season.

Bring to a low simmer and cook until almost all the liquid has been absorbed. Now stir in the grated cheese until it melts. Take off the heat and serve in bowls with crusty bread.

#### Variations

The mushrooms and pepper can be changed or added to with any other veg you want really. Thinly sliced butternut squash or courgette is nice.


### Celeriac remoulade

Serves 3/4 people as a starter.

#### Ingredients

* 7 tbsp good quality mayonnaise.
* 3 tbsp Dijon mustard.
* Juice of 1 lemon.
* 1 small celeriac, ~650g.
* Toast and watercress, to serve.


#### Method

Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, and lemon juice together in a large bowl with a sprinkling of salt and ground black pepper, so it all becomes one sauce.

Peel and quarter the celeriac, then quickly grate it coarsely and stir it into the sauce until evenly coated. Serve with toast and plenty of watercress.


### Dream biscuits

#### Ingredients

* 120g butter
* 200g caster sugar
* 240g plain flour
* 80ml sunflower oil
* 2tsp vanilla essence
* 1/2tsp baker's ammonia
* 1/2tsp grated lemon zest

#### Method

Cream together the butter and caster sugar with an electric mixer. Add the vanilla and oil and beat until combined. Stir in the baker's ammonia and lemon zest.  
Sieve in the flour and mix to form an even dough.  
Wrap the dough in clingfilm, and chill in the fridge for at least half an hour. Preheat the oven to 150C. Grease two large baking sheets.  
Roll the chilled dough into small balls and press them onto the baking sheet. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.  

### Earl Grey biscuits

#### Ingredients

* 2 cups plain flour
* 2 tbsp finely ground earl grey (I found that this was equal to about 4tbsp of leaves before grinding)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 cup butter, softened
* 1/2 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tbsp grated orange zest

#### Method

Mix the flour, tea and salt together in a small bowl and set aside.
Beat the butter, sugar and orange zest together with an electric mixer
until the butter is fluffy. Slowly mix in the flour mixture until it
is all well-combined.

Form the dough into two long logs 3-4cm thick, and wrap them up in
baking paper. Put them in the fridge until the dough is firm enough
to cut (1 - 1.5 hours).

Preheat the oven to 180C, and line two baking trays with baking paper.
Cut the dough into thin biscuits and spread them out on the trays.
Bake for ~15 mins or until slightly golden. Leave to cool on a rack.

Put the potatoes and radishes in a roasting dish with 3 tbsp on the oil, seasoned with salt and pepper.
Put the dish in the oven for ~40 minutes, tossing halfway through.

To make the dressing, blend the remaining oil with the garlic, lemon juie, yoghurt, and dill. Stir again before serving.

Remove the veg from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes. Toss the salad with the dressing and add the vegetables. Shred the mackerel fillets and add them to the mix as well.

Chop the spring onions and peppers finely and put them in a bowl with the tofu. Stir the sweet chili sauce through the mix.

Serve the mixture on top of bowls of the rice, and top with the sliced avocado.

### Winter veg couscous

This recipe serves 3/4 people.

I stole it from Yotam Ottolenghi, which is why there are so many ingredients. Some can be left out. I didn't include the saffron threads from his original recipe because I'm not rich.

#### Ingredients

* 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
* 2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks
* 8 shallots, peeled and halved/quartered
* 2 cinnamon sticks (a few shakes of powder will work fine as well)
* 4 star anise (optional)
* 3 bay leaves (optional)
* 5 tbsp olive oil
* ½ tsp ground ginger
* ¼ tsp ground turmeric
* ¼ tsp hot paprika
* ¼ tsp chili flakes
* 300g pumpkin/butternut squash, peeled and cut into chunks
* 75g dried apricots, roughly chopped (optional)
* 400g can of chickpeas, with water (DO NOT drain)
* 200g (dry) couscous
* 300ml boiling veg stock
* ~50g harissa paste
* freshly chopped coriander (optional)
* salt and pepper to taste


#### Method

Preheat the oven to 190°C. Put the carrots, parsnips and shallots in a large ovenproof dish. Add the cinnamon, star anise, bay leaves, oil, ¾ teaspoon salt, and all the other spices and mix well. Place in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.

Add the pumpkin/squash and return to the oven. Cook for another 35 or until the vegetables have softened reasonably while retaining a bite. Now add the dried apricots and chickpeas with their water, stir around, and cook for a further 15 minutes or until it looks done.

About 15 minutes before the veg is done, put the couscous in a large heatproof bowl with a little oil and ½ teaspoon salt. Pour in the veg stock, and cover and leave for 10 minutes. Then fluff up the couscous and stir in the harissa paste.

To serve, spoon the couscous onto a bowl or plate and spoon the
vegetables onto the couscous. Finish with chopped coriander if desired.


### Homemade kimchi

Makes around a litre of kimchi
(requires a preserving jar)

#### Ingredients

* 1 large Chinese leaf cabbage (700g), washed, quartered and cut into 3–4cm-wide slices
* 50g fine sea salt
* 4–6 garlic cloves, peeled
* 20g fresh root ginger, peeled and thickly sliced
* 20g gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)
* 150g mooli (Chinese radish), peeled and cut into 3mm-wide strips that are around 5cm long
* 5 spring onions, cut into 3mm-wide strips that are around 5cm long
* 100g (approximately 1 medium) carrot, peeled and cut into 3mm-wide strips that are around 5cmn long


#### Method

Wash your equipment thoroughly in warm soapy water, then rinse well under very hot water and leave to air dry.

Put the cabbage in the clean mixing bowl and separate using your fingers. Arrange in layers, with a little salt sprinkled between each layer. Cover the bowl with a plate and leave to stand for 2–3 hours. The cabbage will soften and become limp, and should be sitting in a pool of water when you return to it. It will have reduced in volume by about a third.

Drain the salted cabbage in the clean colander, then return to the bowl. Cover with cold water and swirl the cabbage around, then set aside to soak for 10 minutes. Drain in the colander and return to the bowl. The cabbage should taste slightly salty.

In a blender or pestle and mortar, grind the garlic, ginger and chilli flakes to a paste.

Add the mooli, spring onion and carrot to the cabbage and tip in the chilli paste. Thoroughly massage the paste into the vegetables. 

Spoon the cabbage mixture into the clean jar until it comes up to just under the top of the jar. There is no need to pack it too tightly but you don’t want too much air to reach the surface of the vegetables. Cover with the lid and fasten securely.

Leave in a cool, dark place at room temperature (around 18–20C) for 2–3 days. If your room is warmer, the kimchi will ferment more quickly. Taste the kimchi. If it tastes spicy, sour and slightly cheesy with a good umami flavour, it can be transferred to the fridge to slow down the fermentation process.Even in the fridge, you may need to ‘burp’ the container to release the gas after a few days.

You can begin to eat your kimchi right away, but it will continue to ripen and become more fully flavoured the longer it is fermented. 

### Korean salmon and kimchi fried rice 

Makes two portions.

#### Ingredients
  
*for the salmon*
* 50g brown sugar
* 60ml soy sauce
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* ½ teaspoon freshly grated ginger (about 10 grates)
* 2 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce (sambal oelek or similar)
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch
* 400g salmon fillets
*for the rice*
* 3 tablespoons vegetable or light olive oil
* 750g leftover cold rice (equals approx. 300g uncooked)
* 2 eggs
* 100ml kimchi, plus some juice from the jar
* 3 spring onions, sliced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* soy sauce and/or salt, to taste
*to serve*
* pak choi
* fresh kimchi

#### Method

*for the salmon*
Whisk together all the sauce ingredients in a small pot. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring as you go.

Preheat the grill to high. Cover the salmon thoroughly with about half of the sauce. Save the rest for serving. 

Grill the salmon for about 10 minutes. Drizzle over the remaining sauce before serving.

*for the rice*
Heat the oil to a medium heat in a non-stick frying pan. When the oil is hot, add the rice to the pan and stir it a few times to heat through and toast slightly.

Add the kimchi and 2 tablespoons of the juice from the jar and stir to coat. Between each stir, let the rice sit to brown a bit on the bottom.

Move the rice to the side of the pan and crack the eggs right in the center. Quickly scramble the eggs, mixing them into the rice as you go.

Taste the rice and add dashes of soy sauce and sprinkles of salt until the rice is flavorful – at least ½ teaspoon salt and 2 teaspoons soy sauce, probably more depending on your taste.

When the rice is crispy in some places, stir in the butter and spring onions. 

*to serve*
Serve immediately with the salmon, freshly steamed pak choi and more kimchi.

### Kimchi pancake

Serves 1 as a small meal, or 2 as a side.

#### Ingredients

*for the pancake*
* 70g plain flour
* 1 tbsp cornflour
* ½ tsp baking powder
* pinch sea salt
* 1 large free-range egg yolk
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for frying
* 150g kimchi, roughly chopped, plus 1½ tbsp kimchi juice (from the jar)
* 1 large spring onion, trimmed and roughly chopped
*for the dipping sauce*
* ½ tbsp soy sauce
* ½ tsp rice wine vinegar
* ½ tsp toasted sesame oil
* pinch gochugaru, or other red chilli flakes

#### Method

Whisk together the flour, cornflour, baking powder and sea salt in a jug. Add the egg yolk, oil and 4 tablespoons of cold water and whisk to make a thick batter.

Fold the kimchi and spring onion into the batter along with the kimchi juice.

Heat a splash of oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium–high heat. Add the pancake batter, pushing it out with a wooden spatula so it reaches the edges. Cook for a couple of minutes until the bottom of the pancake is golden brown and the top just starts to set, then turn it over and cook for a few more minutes until both sides are browned and crisp.

Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce by whisking together all of the ingredients in a small bowl.

Slide the pancake from the pan and cut into bite-sized strips. Serve with the dipping sauce.

### Plum and almond sponge cake

#### Ingredients
* 200g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
* 200g golden caster sugar
* 4 large free-range eggs
* 100g plain flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 130g ground almonds
* 50g roasted hazelnuts, chopped
* 120g golden marzipan, chopped
* 500g (about 12) ripe plums, stoned and cut into quarters

#### Method
Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan160°C/gas 4. Lightly grease a 23cm square tin that’s 5cm deep and line the base with baking paper.

In a big bowl, cream the butter and sugar with a hand-held electric whisk until pale, light and fluffy, then gradually add the eggs, whisking between each addition. Sift over the flour and baking powder, add the ground almonds and fold in gently with a big spoon. Fold in the hazelnuts and marzipan.

Pour the mix into the tin and scatter the plum quarters over, pushing them down a little into the mixture. Bake for 50 minutes until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Scatter with the flaked almonds.

Cool a little in the tin and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

For the lemon icing, sift the icing sugar into a bowl, add the lemon juice and stir to a single-cream consistency. Use a teaspoon or piping bag to drizzle the icing over the cake, then cut into squares and serve as a teatime treat.

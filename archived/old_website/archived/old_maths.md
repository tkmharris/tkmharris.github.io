Between 2011 and 2015 I did a PhD with [Dr. Bernhard K&ouml;ck](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/bk2.page) in the [Mathematics Department](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/") at the University of Southampton. My research was in algebraic K-theory.

I have used Grayson's [algebraic description](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0988/kbc.pdf) of the higher algebraic K-groups to give fully algebraic proofs of some of the fundamental properties of K-theory.
More recently, in joint work with Bernhard K&ouml;ck and Lenny Taelman, I have been working to describe exterior power operations on higher K-theory using this algebraic approach.
You can read about these results in the publications below, or in my thesis: [Binary complexes and algebraic K-theory](/maths/thesis.pdf) (2015).

### Other mathematical activity

* In 2012/2013 I was the organiser of the Southampton
[pure PG seminar](/maths/seminars/).
* I used to organise a series of
[seminars for undergraduates](http://ugseminars.co.nf/).
* I was a teaching assistant for a variety of undergraduate modules at Southampton.</br>
I also taught Galois theory to advanced A-level students at
[Winchester college](http://www.winchestercollege.org/).

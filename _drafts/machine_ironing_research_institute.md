The sleeves of my shirt are creased around the forearms. I didn't pay attention when my mother taught me to iron before I left home for university, and I can't be bothered to learn now. I think of mum ironing in her kitchen. The way she stands at the board reminds me of a 1950s filmstrip I saw once about the home of the future. It first showed a busy American housewife going about her tasks, then the same housewife wide-eyed, watching a robot assistant perform the unpaid labour she'd shouldered all these years.
The big clunky Lost in Space robots make me smile. I think of a good tweet.

"its pretty fucked how a robot can compile playlists for me but i still have to do my own ironing"

It seems right to play the character who writes 'i's lowercase and ignores punctuation. I hit return and wait for recognition.
Some likes and retweets trickle in over the next ten minutes, not as many as I'd hoped. I write a follow up, grammatically-correct me again:

"Although, now I think about it, robots are pretty shit at playlists as well."

This goes down rather better, although I think it's a much worse tweet. Dissatisfied, I close the tab and get back to the work I'm supposed to be doing.

I worry about the profile its makers are drawing from the data it is harvesting about me. But I worry in the abstract, like I worry about the occasional twinging in my second right molar. I haven't been to the dentist for 7 years.

On Friday morning the doorbell rings. It's 10am and I'm still in bed. My plans for a long weekend away with friends have collapsed, but I already requested the time off. I pull on tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt and scramble down the stairs to the door.

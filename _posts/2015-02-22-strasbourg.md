This week I am at the IRMA in Strasbourg for a masterclass in topological
K-theory and applications. Strasbourg is as beautiful as I remember it,
although the weather is a [little grey]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2015-02-22/ponts_couverts.jpg) at the moment.
The old town on the Grand &Icirc;le is full of nice old stone buildings and
bridges, and things that are begging to be climbed over and explored. This city
makes me want to be a medieval spy, creeping along the rooftops at night.

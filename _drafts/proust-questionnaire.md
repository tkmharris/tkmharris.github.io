1. *What is your idea of perfect happiness?*  

As others have remarked, the idea of one thing bringing perpetual and perfect happiness is probably incoherent; happiness, as distinct from contentedness, must contain some element of novelty. The days I've been happiest have very rarely been days I've planned to be perfect. If I could live an unstressful, mostly contented life without needing to work on tings I didn't want to, and have those unplanned extremely good days come along at a fairly regular clip, one a month say (sorry Elbow, one a year isn't enough), I'd consider myself extremely lucky.  

If we're going to for the actually impossible: that feeling when you meet someone new you like and who likes you too, and while nothing has happened between yet you're pretty sure it's going to soon, if I could take that feeling and stretch it out forever (impossible in at least two ways), that would be a kind of bliss.

2. *What is your greatest fear?*  

Severe brain damage that I am aware of, either in myself or someone I am close to, or to be trapped in unending unmanageable pain with no exit.

3. *What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?*  

It's a toss-up between my impatience and inability to contain frustration with others and my (moral) cowardice.

4. What is the trait you most deplore in others?

5. Which living person do you most admire?

6. *What is your greatest extravagance?*  
Dorset cereals.

7. What is your current state of mind?

8. *What do you consider the most overrated virtue?*  

Chastity seems to be the obvious answer here.

9. *On what occasion do you lie?*  

A habit I should get out of is lying to simplify the thing I want to say. If I recounting something that happened to me and there's a detail that I can't omit but which I know will derail the conversation or not convey the point I want to make well, then I'll often change it in the retelling. Most of the time this is harmless and explainable, but it's probably a tic that I could unconsciously abuse, or which could cause me embarrassment.

I also lie to the machines at train stations about which service I'm getting on a given route: I buy the cheapest ticket and then just get on the most convenient train.

10. *What do you most dislike about your appearance?*  
I wish I were 10-15cm taller and my hair were blonder and still full.

11. *Which living person do you most despise?*  

Paul Dacre.

14. Which words or phrases do you most overuse?

15. *What or who is the greatest love of your life?*  

I don't think I have an answer to this yet.

16. *When and where were you happiest?*  

On a train outside Geneva in a snowstorm, 2013.

17. *Which talent would you most like to have?*  

Either professional-level musicianship or professional-level skill at gymnastics.

18. *If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?*  

I would be more considerate of others.

19. *What do you consider your greatest achievement?*  

It ought to be getting a PhD but actually it's my modest achievement at things I have no natural talent at: getting quite good at running, learning to juggle.

20. *If you were to die and come back as a person or a thing, what would it be?*  

Either as a cat or as little bird, a sparrow or robin.

21. *Where would you most like to live?*  

I'd divide my time between a small-but-lively medieval Northern European city (which gets proper snow in the winter) and an island in the Baltic for the summers.

22. *What is your most treasured possession?*  
Almost everything I have is easily replaceable so I'm finding it hard to find an answer to this one that isn't "my data". I have some quite nice rocks I picked up while walking that I'd miss?

23. What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?

24. *What is your favorite occupation?*  
Hiking in a beautiful landscape / spending an unhurried afternoon in a caf&eacute; reading a really good book.

I want to be liked.

Quickly.

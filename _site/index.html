<h2>Maths</h2>

<p>Between 2011 and 2015 I did a PhD with <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/bk2.page">Dr. Bernhard K&ouml;ck</a> at the University of Southampton. My research was in algebraic K-theory. My <a href="/assets/files/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> was about Grayson's algebraic presentation of the higher algebraic K-groups.</p>

Last Monday I started my new job as a maths editor at Cambridge University Press. Roughly my job entails keeping up with trends in maths, bringing in new books to publish, and following them through production. It's a bit of a change from research, but it's nice to have found a job where I can use my maths knowledge to a useful (and non-evil) end. My colleagues are all very friendly, and so far CUP seems like a great place to work.  

I'm staying in an Airbnb for the first month here, until I can move into somewhere more permanent in late August. Cambridge is beautiful in the Summer. I think I'm going to enjoy living here. Yesterday I cycled down to Grantchester meadows and had a swim in the river Cam.

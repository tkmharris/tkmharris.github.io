This June, after travelling to Reykjavík for work and [a little bit of tourism](/2017/07/09/reykjavik/), I spent the better part of a week hiking in Iceland's Southern highlands. I have some experience of mountain walking (solo and in small groups), but this was the first big trip I've done on my own. The short version is: it went really well, I had a great time. The trails I walked&mdash;Laugavegur, a daywalk around Þórsmörk, and the Skógar trail over Fimmvörðuháls&mdash;are all absurdly scenic. If you're into hiking, and you have the time and resources, I really recommend taking this trip. In good weather the walks themselves are not very challenging and could be completed by anybody healthy and not too unfit.

That said, the weather is very variable in the interior of Iceland and the trails come with lots of warnings. I was lucky and had generally good weather, but it is important to take the advice of the wardens. In the weeks before my trip, when I started to think seriously about my kit and provisions, I made myself pretty anxious reading the very stern safety notices and the horror stories of calamnaties that have befallen other walkers on these paths. Somebody dies here every other year[^1] and many more are evacuated with hypothermia. The wind and rain can be pretty brutal, and on the high passes it can become very hard to navigate in the fog. Blizzard white-outs are not uncommon and people routinely get lost and caught out in the weather and have to be rescued.

Before I went I feared I had taken on too much. Perhaps I should have done a similar multi-day solo trip somewhere safer and less remote, or instead done this trip with a friend? But by this point I had spent quite a lot of money, I had told a lot of people I was going, and anyway, what was I, a man or a mouse? So I went down to the outdoors shop and spent more money than I could afford on equiptment: new overtrousers, merino base layers for top and bottom, a thick scarf, biovac emergency bag, extensible walking pole for safely crossing rivers, and a handheld GPS device. I also rented an emergency radio locator beacon in Reykjavík to take with me, so if the absoutely worst happened and I got completely lost and started suffering from hypothermia, I could put all my clothes on, climb into my biovac bag, set off the beacon and wait to be rescued.[^2]

So, reassured at least that I wasn't going to die, I got up early one typical drizzly morning in Reykjavík, shouldered my bag full of equiptment and food (mainly oats, pasta, and tinned fish), and walked down to the station to catch the bus to [Landmannalaugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmannalaugar).

#### Landmannalaugar

The bus journey was not encouraging. The landscape got rapidly more forbidding and the weather deteriorated quickly. After an a couple of hours driving on the ring road towards  the South of the island we turned off of regular highways altogether and headed onto bumpy, jarring mountain mountain roads. At one point the bus stopped to allow us out to stretch our legs and take in a glacial river. Everybody else seemed comfortable and excited; I was shivering and afraid. The river was the bright eerie blue of seriously cold meltwater. It looked like a grave.

From that stop it was another hour along decreasingly road-like roads to Landmannalaugar. I'd been regularly checking the Ferðafélag Íslands ([Icelandic Hiking Association](https://www.fi.is/en)) Facebook page in the preceding weeks, and I was glad to see that the snow covering Landmannalaugar had finally melted. Everything was soggy, but at least pretty green:

![Landmannalaugar](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

The first trail I was going to walk was the [Laugavegur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugavegur), which runs 55 very varied km from Landmannalaugar to Þórsmörk. Since we were due to arrive in Landmannalaugar at 1pm, my plan had been to do just a short section of the trail on the first afternoon, 4.5 hours uphill to the FI Hut at the pass at Hrafntinnusker. By the time we arrived though it was clear that it wasn't a good day for walking. The rain was like bullets and my coat was no match, I was extremely cold and damp within a few minutes of being outside. I went to the information hut and they told me that the weather reports from Hrafntinnusker (another 400m higher up and still covered in snow) were sufficiently worrying that the wardens were "strongly advising" walkers to stay the night at Landmannalaugar. So I dropped off my bag in the dorm room in the hut and settled in for the afternoon.[^3]

Besides being the start point of the Laugavegur (and numerous other walks in the area), Landmannalaugar is famous for its hot springs&mdash;"Landmannalaugar" loosely translates as "The Common Man's Pools". I had planned to just take a look at the pools before starting out, but since I was delayed for the day I was able to take a dip. That meant walking the 100m to the springs outside in the driving rain in my trunks, but I fugured the water would make up for it. Most people I suppose, when they think of hot springs in Iceland, think of the [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.com/) or similar; the pools at Landmannalaugar are a little less fancy:
![Landmannalaugar hot springs](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar-springs.jpg){:.center width="90%"}
I later found out that the nice even temperature you get at the Blue Lagoon is not an accident: the whole thing was purpose built as a tourist attraction. It turns out real hot springs aren't lovely bathwater rising from the ground. Instead there is a freezing cold river and a few springs of literally boiling water spewing out from underground into it. One sits on the gravelly riverbed and tries to find a position where the hot and cold mix to a bearable medium, getting periodicallly burned or too cold as the wind and currents change. Which is not to say I didn't like it, but it wasn't the luxury experience I had anticipated. I stayed in for about an hour though, huddled around the springs like penguins with the other bathers, trying to ignore the rain in our eyes. It was an experience anyway. When I got out I realised somebody had mistakenly taken my towel and I had to make my way back shivering violently in the rain. It seems a bit ridiculous to say now, but at the time I felt like I understood, physicaly for the first time, how easy it would be to die of cold.

I whiled away most of the rest of the day reading a book on my eReader (*Silas Marner* &ndash; George Eliot) and exchanging nervous pleasantries with other hikers. Some were clearly old hands, but others seemed no more serious about it than me. A large guided tour group of twenty or so (mostly) Americans were in high spirits, presumably because they were paying not to have to worry (or cook their own meals; I felt very uncharitable to these people all week). As far as I could tell, there was only one other solo hiker staying in the hut, a Canadian woman caled Amy. She told me she had also been forced to delay her start, but wasn't planning to do a double stage the next day. Most of the others were small groups of 2,3 or 4 people who seemd about as prepared as me, but less nervous (perhaps from experience). This was only my impression of the people in the huts though; the people camping outside seemed like a much hardier folk. I admired them, but I was extremely pleased to have chosen to fork out the £50 a night for the huts rather than camp in this place. The accomodation in the hut was pretty basic&mdash;your £50 buys a mattress in a dorm room for 20 and access to a shared kitchen and bathroom&mdash;but the campsite was a world away from my experience:
![Landmannalaugar campsite](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/landmannalaugar-campsite.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

After dinner (pasta, tinned mackerel & red pesto) I shared tea and talked with two Germans, Anna from Freiburg and her friend Laura from Berlin. They were good Leftists (Anna is doing her PhD on critiques of capitalism) and immediately understood my conflicting feelings about Brexit and the EU.[^4] We got on well and I was sorry not to be walking with them&mdash;they were planning to set out on the Lauvegur the next day as well, but would only go so far as Hraftinnusker and so would be a day behind me for the rest.

When the rain finally stopped at around 10pm, Anna and Laura went for a late evening walk (there being plenty of light at this time of year, no real night in fact, just twilight). I settled into bed, read a bit more of *Silas Marner*, and went to sleep early.


### Day 1: Landmannalaugar &ndash; Álftavatn

The first section of the Laugavegur goes 12km along and 530 metres up from Landmannalaugar to the FI hut at the Hraftinnusker pass: not a huge altitude change for that horizontal distance. The height is gained through a pleasant mix of gentle slopes and short steep climbs, which makes for a pretty invigorating morning's walk.

After breakfast (porridge made with dehydrated milk; passable), and some time spent anxiously re-checking my equipment, I set off shortly before 8am. After layering up against the cold and damp, the exercise made me almost immediately too warm and I had to keep stopping to remove layers. The first couple of km of the walk go through a field of lava boulders. As soon as the hut was out of sight I was struck by the utter otherworldliness of it. To start with I couldn't walk more than a hundred metres without stopping to take a picture of some standing boulder or of the multicoloured rhyolite hills in the distance. I'd expected to take a lot of photos, but I realised pretty soon that I'd have to start rationing them out if I wanted to get anywhere. An American couple, James & Julie, had started out at the same time as me and their progress was similarly halting as they stopped for pictures and to adjust their layers. We passed each other back and forth all through the boulder field, until we reached the first steep hill and I left them behind. I don't want to be too immodest, but I'm good at hills.

That first steep climb was accompanied by a persistent sulfur smell. I could see gasses venting from the flanks of the hills on either side and I was catching the smell diluted by the wind. Although there were blocks of unmelted ice scattered around the path, there were also patches of ground that were hot to the touch. It was Mordor in Winter. Near the top of the climb I passed a family with two children who couldn't have been older than 12. I realised that i wasn't nervous any more and was bginning to enjoy myslef. The exercise had loosened my body and released some anxiety; the prescense of literal children on the walk removed a lot of the feeling of danger.[^5] I gave them a cheerfully mispronounced *Góðan daginn* as I passed and sped on to the top of the hill.

![Snowy hills](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day1-snowy-hills.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

From there I followed a sweeping curve overlooking a valley with more hotspots and pools of bright acidic-green water (more hints of sulfur on the air). The hills around started getting properly snowy, and path crossed its first patch of unmelted packed ice.
Then another steep climb, and when it levelled off again the path was more under ice than not. Forced to slow down a bit, I noticed I was starting to get chilly, more from the wind coming accross the open snowfield than the air temperature. I put on my hat and new mittens and trudged on. After a couple of kilometres I met a group of extremely upbeat Australians coming down the other way. They warned me that there was fresh snow on top the mountain I was headed up. Apparently there had been in a blizzard the previous evening; I was happier than ever not to have set out the day before. But the weather was clear, they said and there were fresh prints to follow. They also told me not to miss the "epic hotspot" ahead.

And to be fair to them, it was very cool. I'd seen the steam pouring from the ground at a distance, but it was another thing to get up close and [stand in the middle](https://goo.gl/MdL4fq) of an eggy cloud, with boiling water erupting right under my boots. My favourite thing of all was the way that the heat seemed to carve the snow, leaving unnatural-looking vertical faces as if a giant had been along with a butter knife.

![Hotspot](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day1-hotspot.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

After the hotspot the path dips down into a small valley where a signpost indicates an alternative path back to Landmannalaugar. The Laugavegur then climbs steeply one more time before settling out into a broad rise covered in fresh snow. The walking here was pretty hard going and the wind was biting. I put my coat on and got out my new walking pole for the first time. I stumbled about in the powder a lot, but the pole caught me and I made my way slowly forwards.  Navigationally this was very easy, I just had to follow the waymarkers and footprints into the right pass. But I was beginning to appreciate how hard it would be if snow or fog kept you from seeing the next pole. At a distance all the passes looked the same to me, and I wouldn't be confident of finding the right one.

The view on the approach to FI hut at Hraftinnusker through the pass is very romantic. A tiny hut sits in the snow, tucked away under the crest of the hill to shelter it from the wind. A nearby hotspot supplies warm water. The last slope down to the hut is shingled with shards of obsidian. I was very pleased not to have been up here in the blizzard (and even more pleased not to be one of the unfortunates who opted to camp here), but I was a bit dissapointed at missing out on a night up in the snow.

![Hraftinnusker](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/hraftinnusker.jpg "FI hut at Hraftinnusker"){:.center width="90%"}

I arrived at the hut just before 11am, closely followed by James and Julie, who had caught up on the snow thanks to the micro spikes they'd attached to their boots. It had taken me 3 hours to walk here from Landmannalaugar, contrary to my guidebook's estimate of 4.5 hours (see? Good at hills). Since we weren't guests at the hut we ony had access to the porch area, so I crammed down some lunch (malt loaf, raisins and nuts) and forged on towards Álftavatn.

After a couple more kilometres across the snowfields, the path crosses a series of gullies. Apparently this section is harder work in the high season once all the snow has melted; I was able to skip a couple of gullies by walking over ice bridges. (One gully had an ice *tunnel* running through it; I couldn't resist that, so I took off my bag and walked through it, stopped over. Don't tell my mum.) I found this bit of the walk a lot of fun, especially the last gully which is full of sticky volcanic mud and more unnatural smells.

When the gullies are over, the descent begins. From here you can see all way to the lake Álftavatn in the distance, the next stop, where the landcsape is less forbidding.

![Álftavatn valley view](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day1-valley-view.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

This section is a very long downhill and quite tough on my knees. I'm much slower (relatively) going downhill than uphill and had to pick my way down with my pole. I was given quite pitying looks as I was overtaken by a group of people *running* down the hill, who I assumed must be training for the [Laugavegur ultramarathon](http://www.marathon.is/ultramarathon).

Finally the path flattened out, but there was one more trial for the day: the first proper river crossing. The guidebooks had told me that there is no avoiding getting you feet wet a few times on the Laugavegur. The reccomended river crossing method is to switch your boots for a pair of quick-drying shoes, roll up your trousers and go slowly across using your pole for stability (you don't want to fall over in the river because that's a really good shortcut to hypothermia). the reccommended method is exactly what i did, except the bit about going slowly because the water is unbelivably cold. Physical pain in the feet is instant and bone deep. Luckily this first river was a narrow one and it was over in about 10 seconds, but it made me wary for the crossings to come.

From the river it was just a couple more easy kilometres down to the hut at Áltavatn. I arrived shortly after 3 and went straight to sleep for a couple of hours, having not slept very well the night before. When I woke up there were three military-grade German men sharing my room, all roughly the size and shape of Daniel Craig (and one who had the same face). They told me that they'd stayed the night at Hraftinnusker and had been lost in the blizzard for two hours, all looking a bit harrowed when they spoke about it. Still, they seemed quite impressed that I was on my own and that I'd walked from Landmannalaugar in 7.5 hours.

In the kitchen I met a new batch of people, including another English man, Steve, who shared his teabags with me. The Canadian lady Amy was there as well, she'd changed her mind and done the double stage after all. Much later the tour group of Americans arrived, their bags having been brought by jeep and a giant pot of goat stew waiting for them. I was very jealous of the stew, but got to wallow in a slightly shameful feeling of superiority at having carried all my own equipment and not taken over 11 hours to get here (presumably the whole group has to move at the pace of the slowest person; some of them looked very slow).

![Áltavatn path](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/alftavatn-path.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

When I arrived at the hut there had been gales and I had gotten inside at the earliest opportunity. Now in the evening the sun was shining and people sat out on the raised platforrms chatting in huddles until late. I took a stroll down to the water's edge before bed, but for I once passed on the idea of a swim. Instead I retreated, made a cup of hot chocolate and said my goodnights.


#### Day 2: Álftavatn &ndash; Emstrur

![Áltavatn morning](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/alftavatn-morning.jpg){:.center width="90%"}


Quite spread out, so I was lucky to catch up a couple of workers just in time to get a picture in the world's best posing spot.

#### Day 3: Emstrur &ndash; Þórsmörk

Less striking and good for individual photographs. More interesting for how the landcape slowly changes.

#### Day 4: Daywalk around Þórsmörk, including Rjúpnafell

![Crag](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day4-crag.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

just like in English, Icelandic uses *fell* to mean a small mountain. The Icelandic word for proper-sized mountains is *Fjall* (or *Fjöll* in the plural[^6]).

![Rjúpnafell](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/rjupnafell.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

I was surprised when to discover I had 3G when I got to the top, so I seized the opportunity to show off and [posted a video to mastodon](https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/000/856/565/original/3b6206bfbcebc110.mp4). It got a very gratifying number of boosts and faves, and finally got me followed by Eugen. So yeah, I'm big league now.

#### Day 5: Þórsmörk &ndash; Skógar

![Fimmvörðuháls pole](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/day5-pole.jpg){:.center width="90%"}

<div style="font-size: 80%">
[^1]: One death every two years doesn't seem so bad until you consider that no more than 10,000 people walk the Laugavegur trail every year (by my estimate), probably fewer. 20,000:1 chance of death&mdash;still not bad odds. But I had no idea how much experience the typical walker had Laugavegur, perhaps I was less prepared than average and the odds for rubes like me were much worse?
[^2]: I decided that, in the event, I'd probably rather not actually die than risk dying of embarrassment at having to be rescued to be rescued by a big well-prepared Icelandic Real Man. Just.
[^3]: At this time I also realised that the gloves I'd brought with me had a hole in them. Luckily in the high tourist season there's a little shop open at the campsite selling coffess, hot drinks, and extortionitly priced hiking gear. Still afraid of being underequipped in any way, I spent 3500ISK (£25!) on the only gloves they had, these rather natty mittens. ![Mittens](/assets/img/posts/2017-07-13/mittens.jpg){:.center width="50%"} I am very attached to these mittens now. I nearly ran off a cliff chasing them when they blew away in the wind. I love them and I'll take on every waliking trip I go on forever.
[^4]: Basically everybody non-British I meet asks me what I think of Brexit now; I'm always worried that any acknowledgement that the EU is an imperfect neoliberal institution will be taken as support for the kind of xenophobia that drove the referendum result. (I'm Remain, just not #Remain.)
[^5]: These turned out to be the only children I saw all week though; perhaps their parents were just very confident (or irresponsible?)
[^6]: I learned this trying to translate the poem *Fjöll* by [Jóhannes úr Kötlum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3hannes_%C3%BAr_K%C3%B6tlum) with my phone. A framed print of it hung on the wall in the Þórsmörk FI hut.
[^7]: I don't know very much about photographic composition, but I think this might be the 'best' photograph I took on the hike. The colours are nice.

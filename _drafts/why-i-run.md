These days its like smoking, I don't run because it makes me feel good, I run because not running makes me feel bad. 
Runner's high exists, but it's not enough to make me want to go a lot of the time. 
There are mental health benefits, but I don't think they're the kind you can measure easily. 
So why do it? partly because it's good for me and training myself out of the feel bad mechanism would be detrimental to long-term health. 
partly because it's egalitarian. 
partly because despite my low level of achievement, I'm absurdly proud of being much better than almost every member of the general public at something I have absolutely no natural talent for (like being able to juggle 3 balls—even, for short periods, 4!—in spite of hand-eye coordination somewhere in the doldrum percentiles)

#### Book Shambles with Robin & Josie
Books podcast from Robin Ince and Josie Long, both of whom I have a lot of time for.

#### Overdue
Unlike *Book Shambles* this is very structured.
Like a good review, some spoilers but most of the time not too much.
Bit annoying trying to please everybody sometimes, but hey ho (LotR episodes)

#### Talking Politics
Weekly podcast from David Runciman, head of Cambridge's Department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS). He's typically joined by a guest, either one of a panel of regulars from POLIS (most frequently Helen Thompson) or somebody from the world of politics itself. There is some response to the political events of the week, but the real focus is on trying to understand the medium term&mdash;what caused the political upsets of 2016 & 2017, and how things might unfold in the next few years. It *is* quite politics-as-a-fandom, as you would expect from professors of politics, but it's rarely wonkish and doesn't make me actually angry, which is good going.

#### Memetic Hazard
They're also mainly responsible for my now-pretty-much-complete transition from Fascinated Lurker to Very Online, so thanks lads I guess?

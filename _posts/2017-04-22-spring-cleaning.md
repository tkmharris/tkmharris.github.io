I decided to tidy up my website a bit and make it a bit more modern looking. I haven't done any real maths for the better part a year now, so I'm sidelining the bit that shows off my work and making it a more functional blog.

I'm still using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which I can recommend as a simple static site manager if, like me, you don't know an awful lot about websites. After giving up trying to do categories pages with Jekyll the last time I tinkered with the website, I found it's now quite easy with [Jekyll Paginate v2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2). The page layouts are mostly my own work, although I did use some CSS from the [Lagrange](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/) Jekyll theme.

I think the result looks serviceable on the desktop, if not anything special. It looks pretty terrible on mobile at the moment. I'll try to fix that another day when I have some time and more patience with CSS. I'm sure this would all be a lot easier if I sat down for a couple of days and learned some basic principles of web design, but I have limited free time and a lot books I'd like to read.

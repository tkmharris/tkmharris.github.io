I've just finished reading Jessie Greengrass' fantastic first novel [*Sight*](http://evewhite.co.uk/books/sight/). I feel a little strange saying this about a book that is in large part about the difficulties of ever knowing others, or even ourselves clearly, but *Sight* made me feel I knew the author personally more than any novel I've read for a long time, because she is me.

*Sight* weaves together the quiet story of a young woman's passage from grieving her mother to motherhood of her own.

It's not just that our interests and concerns are similar; the thrill of recognition I get from Greengrass' writing comes just as often from a shared aesthetic sensibility. I picked up her short story collection *An account of the decline of the great auk according to one who saw it* (in the superb LRB bookshop) entirely because of the auk. At the reading she said that somebody joked to her that she's only interested in miserable people on blasted islands in Northern seas. Well, ditto. *Sight* is full of the kind of imagery I like&mdash;
THE DRAWING TOGETHER OF SCHOLARLY FLOTSAM - I DIDN'T EXPECT HER TO BE INTERVIEWED BY THE CREATOR (CHECK) OF QI, BUT IT MADE TOTAL SENSE.

But I worry I'm selling *Sight* short by setting an impossible standard: be me and you'll love this book. You don't need to be me. [The writing is excellent. Each sentence is beautifully polished, philosophically precise without philosophical literalism&mdash;sentences subvert in such a way that you wonder why you expected another end to the sentence at all "the baby knees me in the ribs and I snap at it through the intermediary layers of my flesh"].
*Auk* won Greengrass the Edge Hill Short Story prize and a Somerset Maugham award; *Sight* is one of the six books on the Women's Prize for fiction announced this Monday. Hopefully this visibility will bring her the audience she richly deserves.

Between 2011 and 2015 I did a PhD with [Dr. Bernhard K&ouml;ck](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/bk2.page) in the [Mathematics Department](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/") at the University of Southampton. My research was in algebraic K-theory.

I used Grayson's [algebraic description](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0988/kbc.pdf) of the higher algebraic K-groups to give fully algebraic proofs of some of the fundamental properties of K-theory.
In a joint paper with Bernhard K&ouml;ck and Lenny Taelman, I described the exterior power operations on higher K-theory using this algebraic approach.
You can read about these results in the publications below, or in my thesis: [Binary complexes and algebraic K-theory](/maths/thesis.pdf) (2015).

### Publications

1. [Algebraic proofs of some fundamental theorems in algebraic K-theory](/maths/Fund_Thm_Alg_K-theory.pdf)

2. [Exterior power operations on higher K-groups via binary complexes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01685v1.pdf)  
(with Bernhard K&ouml;ck and Lenny Taelman), to appear in *Annals of K-theory*.

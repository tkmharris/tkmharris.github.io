This weekend I went walking in the Brecon Beacons national park with the
university hillwalking club. We couldn't climb the Beacons themselves because
the weather wasn't good enough, but we managed a couple of nice walks at lower
altitudes. On Saturday we did a nice tour of the waterfalls of the rivers
Neath, Mellte and Hepste, starting from Pontneddfechan.
It had rained recently, and the falls were particularly beautiful. Aside from
the famous Sgwd y Eira *("fall of snow")*, my favourite was probably Sgwd Clun-Gwyn
*("fall of the white meadow")*.

On Sunday the weather was a little better, so we climbed Sugarloaf, a small
peak outside of Abergavenny. This was a fairly gentle walk, although there was
a bit of snow once we got high enough, and the wind made it quite cold on top.
By the time we were at the summit it was a bright and clear day, and we were
treated to this gorgeous view.

I was good at poetry in school. Which means I was good at listening to what the teacher told us the themes of the poem were and searching the text for similes and metaphors that evidenced those themes. It wasn't that my classmates and I didn't enjoy reading poems: it's that the idea of a poem as something one could enjoy didn't occur to us. We weren't aware it was a possibility the way it was for stories.

I continued reading poems when I went off to university, into the stage of life when I sought to define myself in terms of reading material. But still I read them like I was taught in school&mdash;as a puzzle to be solved. Most importantly, I always read them alone and in my head.

At some point in my early twenties though I started trying to memorise poems. I can't remember what the impetus for that was, although realistcally it was probably an extension of defining myself by what I read: if you want to be a person who reads poems then being a person who recites poems is even more so that. I started out with Phillip Larkin's *[This Be The Verse](https://allpoetry.com/This-Be-The-Verse)*, back when I still though it was edgy and cool and not desperately sad. I worked for a long time on Tennysson's *Ulysses*, working backwards from the Good Bit at the end. Next a Thomas Hardy, some Seamus Heaney, Silvia Plath, and several more Larkins.

I never did become the kid of person who recites poems to others: understandably enough nobody ever really asks. But I started reciting them to myself, first quietly under my breath and eventually loudly (when nobody's around).

Then I started memorising them. It's a consolation to have words to call on, a familiar pattern to follow.


It sounds silly to say them aloud, especially for me, who is allergic to performance. I am too slightly o early for recordings of the self to feel natural.
But for what it's worth, here's a go at some Larkin. (read The Trees or An Arundel Tomb).

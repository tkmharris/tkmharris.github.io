the life so short, the craft so long to learn

the race is not to the swift

time and chance happen to them all

having mentioned something I turn to its existence

stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine

to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time

building castles in the air

Iâ€™ve always preferred a noble failure to a cheap success

My friends Lewis Wood and Zoe Portnell got married yesterday in the Pantheon
temple at Stourhead gardens. I was lucky enough to be involved in the day's
proceedings, as they very kindly asked me to be one of the ushers.

It was a wonderful day; even the sudden deluge that accompanied post-ceremoney
drinks and canap√©s didn't spoil my mood.
After abandoning the gardens we headed back to the Stourhead courtyard for the
wedding reception, where we forgot ourselves as we drank and danced until it was time to go home.

I'm sure there are plenty of photos to look through. I'm selecting just a few
of my favourites to keep here as a reminder of a great day.

Congratulations to Lewis and Zoe!

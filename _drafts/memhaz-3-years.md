I'm writing on the occasion of my internet pals Adam and Josef celebrating three years of their pod cast [Memetic Hazard](memhaz.com).

A couple of years ago I found myself in a very unfunny situation. I'd had a nervous breakdown, quit my job and career path, and had to live with my parents for the first time in 8 years.
[Something to link these]

I was looking at jobs a young, mathematically minded person could do. Everything was about selling yourself as a genius, one of the brightest, a staggeringly hard worker. 
I didn't want to measure myself in terms of of the work that I do or the money I make. I don't think how interesting a person is is a function of their IQ. I wasn't alone, I had friends and family around me, but nobody I knew had the same concerns. The tech capitalists made me feel alienated and alone.
Then I stumbled upon memhaz. Adam and Josef also had similar nerdy interests, and they also found the rationalists ridiculous. And they were funny about it too. And I felt less alone.
Obviously they were only a minor factor (doctors & medicine helped)
I listened to a lot of the episodes in the archive while I applied for jobs, or walked the dog to get out of the house.

So thanks guys, and here's to three more years.

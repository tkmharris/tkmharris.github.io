These are the books I have read so far in 2017. Re-reads are marked
with an asterisk (&lowast;).
Works read in translation are marked with a dagger (&dagger;).

1. **Neoreaction a Basilisk**, Phil Sandifer.  
An investigation (for lack of a better word) into three curious internet-era writers (Nick Land, 'Mencius Moldbug', Eliezer Yudkowsky) and the bizarre cults that have grown up around their visions of the tech-eschaton.

2. **I Hate the Internet**, Jarett Kobek.  
276 pages of caustic rage directed at rich technologists.

3. **Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic**, Anita & Solomon Feferman.  
A biography of 'the greatest sane logician of the twentieth century' (as he liked to call himself).
As seems to be far too common with great thinkers, it seems that Tarski was an utter shit in his personal life.

4. **A Winter Book**, Tove Jansson.&dagger;  
Lovely short stories for adults by the author of the Moomin books.

5. **The Fish Ladder**, Katharine Norbury.  
A potentially-interesting nature book ruined by the author's unbearable narcissism.

6. **Orkneyinga Saga**, Anonymous.&dagger;  
The saga of the Earls of Orkney from 950ish to 1200ish, written down in Iceland in the early 13th century. Part history, part legend, and frequently unintentially hilarious. Great stuff.

7. **Fingersmith**, Sarah Waters.  
Historical (Victorian setting) crime novel with lesbian themes.

8. **The Secret History**, Donna Tartt.  
Really, really great. Compulsive reading. Not a whodunnit but a *whydunnit*.

9. **Beyond the Northlands: Viking voyages and the Old Norse sagas**, Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough.  
Explores Viking travel and exploration through the lens offered by the sagas. The (delightful) author signed my copy in runes.

10. **A Tale for the Time Being**, Ruth Ozeki.  
I heard about this on the [Overdue podcast](http://overduepodcast.com/) so I knew some of the story in advance. A meditation of sorts on time and suffering, but wrapped up in a flowing story. Its comparisons between Zen Buddhism and quantum physics irked me no end (as always). Otherwise very good.

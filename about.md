Hello, I'm Tom and sometimes I write things.  

I’ve been keeping a blog for the last couple of years. There’s no particular topic: sometimes it’s reflections on things I’ve been reading or thinking about, other times it’s more like a diary. 
I suppose the topic is “things I’d like to share with my friends”. That’s good enough, I think.  

If you want to know more about me, you can go to my [homepage](http://www.tkmharris.net).

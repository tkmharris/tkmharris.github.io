A quick note to say that I am now a doctor (and have been since 3pm-ish on
Wednesday 9 September). You can read my thesis
[here](/maths/thesis.pdf). The examiners were Marco Schlichting
from Warwick and Peter Kropholler from Southampton. The viva lasted about an
hour and a half and I was given no official corrections (though there were a
few typos to fix). In the evening we had dinner in a Thai restaurant, then went
to the Butcher's Hook for some celebratory beers. It's weird being a doctor.
I thought I'd feel cleverer by now.

**Note**
*I tried to write a proper review of Angela Nagle's* Kill All Normies *and, in doing so, to get down on the page a lot of the things I have been thinking about leftist responses to the alt-right. But like everything "culture-war" related, I found myself twisting around in circles, trying to hedge everything and avoid triggering any of the myriad shibboleths for the many parties involved.*
*I find all of this very tiring. I have very few conclusions to make and I probably wouldn't have written this post if I hadn't already ploughed a lot of time into thinking about this stuff and fallen foul of the sunk-cost fallacy. In the end I gave up, but I still think some of this is worth saying, so consider the mess below an advertisement for the long, well-reasoned thinkpiece I'll probably never get around to writing about the alt-right.*

In the final days of summer 2014 a lot of people got very very angry on the internet about the representation of women in video games. Or rather, they got angry about people pushing for less awful representation of women{% fn %} and in video games. I haven't played video games very much since I was a teenager, and I've never participated in the culture surrounding them, so this would normally have passed me by completely. But at the time I was spending most of my evenings alone sitting in my little flat in Southampton, kicking around for things to do instead of writing my PhD thesis, and I got drawn in. Not drawn in enough to actually participate in the arguments of course, but enough to know far more about 'GamerGate' and its various generals, shock troops, and enemies than I ever would have wished for.

At the time we laughed about how ridiculous it all ways, mocking the GamerGators' comically overblown rhetoric, which interpreted mild feminist criticism of a popular media form as a war on white men, the beginning of the literal end of western civilisation.
It's not true that I'm not laughing any more&mdash;these people are still worthy of ridicule as well as contempt, their rhetoric has gotten no less amusing in its delusion&mdash;but I'd prefer the joke stopped.

There's no question that GamerGate marks the beginning of the alt-right as popularly conceived. The mad gamers were not the movement's only or even most important tributary, but their months-long tantrum and the support they attracted from every anti-feminist grifter on the internet marks the crystallisation of these groups into a cultural phenomenon. The mess of resentments that had been bubbling away for years at the progressive victories of liberals in spaces they conceived of as traditionally male burst forth when given the extremely flimsy pretext of "ethics in video games journalism".{% fn %}

This is important because the main thesis of Angela Nagle's book *Kill All Normies: online culture wars from 4chan and Tumblr to Trump and the alt-right* is that the alt-right is a reaction against progressive identity politics. Much criticism of the book has noted that these groups of reactionaries existed long before trigger warnings and feminist criticism of video games became mainstream, and therefore Nagle's analysis is invalid. But this is obviously a flawed criticism: it's true that the constituent parts existed separately for long before, but the alt-right as a mass movement emerged only a couple of years ago. Whether it is really best viewed as a reaction against "Tumblr liberalism" is another question, but the existence of internet shitheads pre-2014 doesn't rule it out.  

This kind of lazy criticism is representative of the response to Nagle's book from the 'identity left'. I don't disagree that *Kill All Normies* is deeply flawed, rushed out to meet the market while the alt-right are still at their peak (...hopefully this is the peak). But there's an irony in all response to a book about culture wars being drawn on explicitly cultural lines. Most people on the identity left reviewing *Kill All Normies* have found things to object to (and there's much that is objectionable), and have then set out to destroy it at all costs, quoting Nagle out of context or arguing as above that because 4chan existed in the early 2000s, the alt-right can't possibly be a reaction against the mainstreaming of trans politics. And anyway, isn't it possible acknowledge the source of a reaction without condemning it or condoning the reactionaries?

Meanwhile the reviews of the book from the section of the left that's not concerned with identity politics (the Chapo left maybe? I don't know) have been extraordinarily uncritical of Nagle's analysis. Nagle's book says things like:
>It seems to me that politics ... has been hollowed out too much into *little other* that a purely cultural politics over the last half-century, which the ugly spectacle of the Trump-Hilary represented the logical conclusion of &ndash; politics as culture war.

and
>In modern politics, liberal leaders are forgiven for drone bombing as long as they're cool with gay marriage

These are exactly the criticisms that the Chapo left (sorry, I really don't like this name either) has been making for years, and it seems that these critics are happy to ignore the failings of one of their own. No mention in their reviews is made of Nagle's rather questionable sexual politics: her air-quoting of "non-binary" and "transphobia", her uncritical acceptance of the narrative that the sexual revolution was responsible for a stratification of male value, creating an army of oppressed "beta males". What these critics seem to be missing is that we can and should care about drone-bombing *and* gay rights, and that we shouldn't let Nagle off the hook for sidelining transphobia because she says good things about the excesses of neoliberalism.  

It's not hard to see how these reactions on ideological lines happened. Nagle's book seems designed in places to rub her critics up the wrong way. Her criticism of the identity left is rather less fair than her criticism of the alt-right: for the most part she lets the hideous views and actions of the alt-right speak for themselves, quoting their repulsive shit at length and allowing us to pass fair judgement. Nagle also quotes various ridiculous Tumblr identitarians at length, but she is happy to lazily characterise them as "hysterical" inhabitants of "intellectually shut-down" worlds while affording Milo & others the benefit of the doubt, treating them as "thinkers" with "ideas" that can be challenged. In the middle of a culture war, anybody reading Nagle's slightly mocking takes is going to identify her as an enemy.

There's common dynamic in online discourse that creates forbidden words and phrases. It goes like this: somebody invents an apt term to describe a behaviour of certain participants in the culture war: 'virtue signalling', 'mansplaining', and of course 'social justice warriors'.{% fn %} The term immediately catches on, because it often contains a kernel of truth. But by catching on it demonstrates its utility in the culture war, since the kernel of truth stings its target, leading antagonists to use it more and more in ever-more irrelevant contexts until it becomes just another word for 'my opponents in this culture war'. The people it is aimed at have, by this point, began to read all use of the term as a shibboleth for their enemies. Anybody using the term 'virtue signalling' to describe some aspect of the behaviour of some subset of the left can now expect to be interpreted as an antagonist, even to describe the very small thing the term was intended to describe. When Angela Nagle talks about virtue signalling using those words, even if she is using the term academically in an earnest discussion of online interactions, she is appearing to some reviewers to be sympathetic to the alt-right.{% fn %}
This is what culture wars do, they degrade the language. Everything is a shibboleth, there can be no communication.

I don't mean to suggest that "both sides are as bad as each other" or that the goals of the left are not worthy; merely I want to offer advice to the left, to say that you cannot win this way. It is better not to play. The shitposters and nihilists of the alt-right are better at this than you, because they genuinely don't care. Their entire ideology is reaction. You will always have misgivings about this language degradation; they will not.

And that's the problem, our opponents are nihilists. *Kill All Normies* fails to address this, and for me that's where it falls apart. Nagle ends her book with a plea for us (the left) to stop engaging in culture wars, to find some other way to combat the rise of the alt-right, to win the "a battle of ideas". She argues that the modern left is not fit for this task:
>When Milo challenged his protesters to argue with him on his tour, he knew that they not only wouldn't, but also that they couldn't. They come from an intellectually shut down world of Tumblr and trigger warnings, and the purging of dissent in which they have only learnt to recite jargon.  

and
> It was on this night, at the end of a yearlong tour throughout which the US campus left spectacularly failed to challenge him on the level of ideas..

And what "ideas" might those be? How do you argue with a man who responds to serious direct criticism by saying "calm down dear", who sells t-shirts that say "feminism is cancer", and whose followers count this behaviour as winning?

Nagle makes a point of distinguishing between the alt-right&mdash;Richard Spencer and his openly neo-Nazi chums&mdash;and the "alt-light"&mdash;Milo, Mike Cernovich, Sargon, and the hundreds of others with a youtube channel and an audience of thousands of credulous idiots. The former are the direct decedents of the 1990s and early 2000s, in some cases they're the same people. They're boring. The latter are the ones who are really interesting (from a cultural studies point of view; I don't actually want to talk to any of them), and they're the ones we are really talking about when we talk about the alt-right. They just didn't exist in any significant numbers before about 2014. I don't know what the alt-right think, but the alt-light? They like it. Mike Cernovich tweeted "Kill All Normies is a broad look and Internet culture and culture wars. Highly recommended."
Of course he recommends it, it's publicity. He's a publicity man and that's all he is.{% fn %} Same for Milo, same for Donald Trump. These people have no coherent political philosophy, they're just making money by saying the most offensive shit they can for the views and retweets.

The way to win is not to play, but how can we not play when this shit has a direct affect of people's lives? I don't know the answer to this question, and neither does Angela Nagle. I do know that going along to a Milo talk and getting up on stage with the goal of owning him in civilised debate isn't going to work.

At the end of all this, not having actually done a review, I'm not sure whether to recommend *Kill All Normies* or not.
The more journalistic parts chronicling the history of the alt-right and its various tributaries are accurate and make a good introduction. But I can't think of anybody who would be interested in reading the book (or this review) who doesn't know all of that already.
The more analytical bits are much less good, seem clearly rushed and incomplete. Nagel makes some good observations but fails to tie them all together into a coherent whole.
*Kill All Normies* was marketed as an academic analysis of the online culture wars, but it contains exactly zero sources and mostly consists of Nagle's journalistic impressions.
Her recommendation that the left just needs to stop talking about trigger warnings and instead defeat the alt-right on the level of ideas ignores the far greater problem of what to do with an opponent who doesn't have any ideas. That problem is never really addressed, and in the age of president Donald Trump that seems like a serious oversight.
It's not a great book, and I can imagine better books about the alt-right. It is in dire need of an editor, and probably should have been either half as long or twice as long.
But if you are interested in these things, and you want to be informed, you ought to read it. the reviews have been so ideologically flavoured that I don't think you can get a fair idea of what it's about from somebody else's reading, unless they happen to be exactly aligned with you in all the various culture wars this book is relevant to. It has the advantage of being very short and quite cheap, so you've got no excuse not to read it if you're going to sound off on Twitter about it.

There's no serious debate to be had here, by the way. The whole GamerGate movement was conceived as an excuse to push back against and punish the people working for better representation in games; this is well-documented in IRC logs from the time. Were there some journalists who behaved less than ethically in support of progressive causes? Almost certainly. Were the GamerGators actually opposing this on a principle rather than looking for ammo in a culture war? Of course not.

'Social justice warrior' has stuck because it so perfectly fits the reactionaries' picture of their opponents. When pushed, most of them will say that it's not the 'scoial justice' that they are opposed to, it's the 'warrior' part: the shaming, the reading everything in the worst possible light. The irony that the alt-right participants in the culture war are exhibiting exactly this same keyboard-warrior behaviour seems lost on them.

I am not going to attempt to rehabilitate the term SJW because its use has become the most powerful outgroup marker of all. There's no way I can use it and carry you along with me.

Similarly, there's no way I could use the term "mansplaining" when talking to an alt-righter without them immediately writing me off as the worst beta male, white knight, friendzoned cuck in the world. Even if I am describing, say, the most boorish dude in the world explaining the Iliad to Mary Beard as he loosely recalls it from watching Brad Pitt in *Troy*. All I'm going to get is incoherent rage or complaints along the lines of "it's such a bullshit term, it could literally be applied to a man explaining anything".

Cernovich posted a follow-up tweet with a picture of the page of the book that talks about him, on which he has scribbled corrections to his number of twitter followers (220k to 300k) and the name of his book ("Guerrilla mindset" to "Gorilla mindset"). That Cernovich responds to a book-length analysis of his movement's history and ideas with a tweet correcting his personal number of followers and book name tells you pretty much everything about what he's in it for.

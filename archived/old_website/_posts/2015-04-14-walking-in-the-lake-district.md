Last week I was on holiday with Ana, and Dave and Lotta, walking in the Lake
District. After packing all my waterproofs and preparing myself for the worst,
the weather turned out gorgeous; six days without rain in the Lakes strikes me
as a minor miracle.

Some of our walks were new. Ana and I walked a tough route to Scafell Pike,
which I'd never climbed before and got a bit lost on the way up, and we all
walked up Blencathra and did a tricky traverse down Sharp Edge. We also re-trod
some old routes from the trip Dave and I took here three years ago with
Ali Campbell. We did the classic route around Helvellyn, up Striding Edge and
down Swirral Edge, with a little diversion to Catstye Cam, which afforded this

lovely view</a>.

On the last day we walked another old route from Ambleside to Patterdale,
taking in six fells along the way. At Cofa Pike I took a photo of

from above. The last time I saw the tarn it was shrouded in mist and looked
as though it might go on forever. I was a little disappointed to have it demystified,
but now that I know it isn't actually magical I have a new goal:
one day I will swim in it.

With the weather so fine, we couldn't resist a few posing photographs.

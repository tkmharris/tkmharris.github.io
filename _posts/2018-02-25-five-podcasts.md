Following [Adam](https://englebright.co.uk/ten-podcasts/), here are five of the podcasts I listen to most frequently.

#### The Relentless Picnic
An excellent podcast which deserves to be much more widely-known. It's three intelligent guys talking rigorously but informally about the topics you have to think hard about to even notice. Day-to-day philosophy, essentially&mdash;their choice of word is "inquiry", which I like a lot. They have to walk a delicate tightrope to be interesting, rigorous and entertaining at the same time, but they manage it most of the time (their hyper-sincere stuff is much better than their Chapo-style skit stuff though). Episode 17&mdash;[The Cave](https://soundcloud.com/relentless-picnic/ep-17-the-cave) from last year is still their very best, but recent episodes 24&mdash;[The Tightrope](https://soundcloud.com/relentless-picnic/ep-24-the-tightrope) & 27&mdash;[The Wreckage](https://soundcloud.com/relentless-picnic/ep-27-the-wreckage) are also great places to start.

#### Book Shambles with Robin & Josie
Books podcast from comedians Robin Ince and Josie Long, both of whom I have a lot of time for. They're joined by a different guest every week for a discussion that's ostensibly about the guest's chosen books but it usually rambles off elsewhere and most episodes end shortly after Robin says "Oh but we haven't talked about your books". Guests include Stewart Lee, Eimear McBride, Greg Proops, Ruby Tandoh, Alan Moore, Helen Czerski, Alexei Sayle, ...

#### Overdue
Unlike *Book Shambles* this is a very structured books podcast. Each week one of the hosts reads a book they haven't read before, the other host talks about the life of the author and some context for the book, and then the first host describes the book and the other questions them about it. It's a book report basically. While there are occasional spoilers, I've more often come away thinking "okay, that's something I'd like to read" that "well, don't need to read that". The hosts are sometimes a little annoying in their hesitancy to criticise some things their  fans like, and they sometimes come a bit close to being *#resistance* types (devoting an episode of your books podcast to a post-election hour-long rant about Trump isn't a good idea in my opinion, especially if the "book" for your next episode after that is the Constitution of the United States). But the core format is good and I've gotten a lot of good recommendations from listening.

#### Talking Politics
Weekly podcast from David Runciman, head of Cambridge's Department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS). He's typically joined by a guest, either one of a panel of regulars from POLIS (most frequently Helen Thompson) or somebody from the world of politics itself. There is some response to the political events of the week, but the real focus is on trying to understand the medium term&mdash;what caused the political upsets of 2016 & 2017, and how things might unfold in the next few years. It *is* quite politics-as-a-fandom, as you would expect from professors of politics, but it's rarely wonkish and doesn't make me actually angry, which is good going.<!-- , it'd be like being angry at a schoolboy for taking the last slice of cake.-->

#### Memetic Hazard
I'm hesitant to really recommend this to people who don't share my niche concerns and ways of thinking, but how could I not? Part of the reason I immediately loved memhaz was the joy of recognising minds like your own across the gulf. There's a true saying: the purpose of art is to make you feel less alone. I'd hesitate to call Adam & Josef's discussions&mdash;about dangerous ideas, awful tech capitalists, the coming eschaton, politics, amateur socio-political theorising and how funny the words "nonce" and "cuck" are&mdash;art *per se*, but they made me feel less alone at a time when I really needed that. They made me laugh a lot when nothing else seemed very funny.  
Memhaz is also mainly responsible for my now-pretty-much-complete transition from Horrified Lurker to Very Online, so thanks lads I guess?  
They're on hiatus at the moment, but there's a solid archive to get stuck into.
